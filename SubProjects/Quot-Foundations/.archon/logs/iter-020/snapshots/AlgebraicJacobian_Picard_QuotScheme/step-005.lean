# The Quot scheme: Quot-foundations layer

This file packages the Quot-foundations layer of the
Grothendieck–Altman–Kleiman Quot-scheme construction. It introduces the
per-fiber Hilbert polynomial of a coherent sheaf, the Quot functor
`Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S}` of `T`-flat coherent quotients, and the Grassmannian
*scheme* (Mathlib at the pinned commit carries only a linear-algebra
Grassmannian) together with its representability.

The 4 blueprint-pinned declarations are:

1. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.hilbertPolynomial` (def) — the
   **Hilbert polynomial function** `s ↦ Φ_{F,s} ∈ ℚ[λ]` of a coherent
   sheaf `F` on `X` over a finite-type `π : X ⟶ S` with respect to a
   line bundle `L`. Encoded as a function `S → Polynomial ℚ`.

2. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.QuotFunctor` (def) — the **Quot
   functor** `Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S} : (Sch/S)^op ⥤ Set` sending an
   `S`-scheme `T ⟶ S` to the set of equivalence classes
   `⟨F, q⟩` of pairs `(F, q)` with `F` a `T`-flat coherent sheaf on
   `X_T`, `q : E_T ↠ F` a surjection, and `F|_{X_t}` having Hilbert
   polynomial `Φ` at every `t ∈ T`.

3. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Grassmannian` (def) — the
   **Grassmannian functor** `Grass(V, d) : (Sch/S)^op ⥤ Set` of
   rank-`d` quotients of a locally free `O_S`-module `V`.

4. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Grassmannian.representable` (theorem)
   — the **representability of the Grassmannian** by a smooth projective
   `S`-scheme `Gr_S(V, d)` of relative dimension `d(r-d)`, equipped with
   the Plücker closed embedding into `ℙ_S(⋀^d V)`.

## Note on type expressivity

Following the project rule "Never weaken the type to dodge the proof",
each declaration carries a substantive, non-tautological type:

- `hilbertPolynomial` returns `Polynomial ℚ` keyed by `s : S`, not
  `Unit`; the Hilbert polynomial is a non-trivial invariant of the
  coherent sheaf at the fiber over `s`.
- `QuotFunctor` and `Grassmannian` return contravariant functors into
  `Type u` — substantive presheaves of sets, not constant functors.
- `Grassmannian.representable` packages the
  `Functor.RepresentableBy` Yoneda-bijection structure: existence of a
  scheme `Y` together with a `RepresentableBy Y` witness — substantive
  content (a representable functor is determined by its representing
  object up to canonical isomorphism, and the witness is the data of
  that isomorphism family).

## Mathlib status

Mathlib (master `b80f227`) provides:
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules` (the category `X.Modules`),
- `Scheme.Modules.pullback`, `Scheme.Modules.pushforward` (the
  pullback–pushforward adjunction at level `i = 0`),
- `CategoryTheory.Functor.RepresentableBy` for representable functors,
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyOfFiniteType`, `AlgebraicGeometry.IsLocallyNoetherian`
  (morphism / object property predicates), and
- `Polynomial` for `ℚ[λ]`.

Mathlib does NOT provide (at the pinned commit):
- a Grassmannian *scheme* (only a linear-algebra Grassmannian
  as a finite-rank-quotient variety),
- the Quot/Hilbert functor or its representability,
- Snapper's Lemma for the polynomial property of Euler characteristics.

/-! ## §1. Hilbert polynomial of a coherent sheaf

For a finite-type morphism `π : X ⟶ S` with `S` noetherian and a coherent
sheaf `F` on `X` whose schematic support is proper over `S` (here encoded
as plain `X.Modules` for the file-skeleton), the per-fiber Hilbert
polynomial is the function

`s ↦ Φ_{F,s} ∈ ℚ[λ],   Φ_{F,s}(m) = χ(X_s, F|_{X_s} ⊗ L_s^{⊗m})`.

Snapper's Lemma ensures this is a polynomial in `m`; the proof requires
graded-Euler-characteristic infrastructure and is not stated here.

Blueprint reference: `def:hilbert_polynomial` (Nitsure §1; cf. Hartshorne
III.5.2). -/

/-- The **Hilbert polynomial** of a coherent sheaf `F` on `X` over `S` at
the fiber over `s ∈ S` with respect to a line bundle `L` on `X`.

Encoded as a function `s ↦ Φ_{F,s} ∈ ℚ[λ]`. The defining formula

`Φ_{F,s}(m) = χ(X_s, F|_{X_s} ⊗ L_s^{⊗ m})
            = Σ_i (-1)^i dim_{κ(s)} H^i(X_s, F|_{X_s} ⊗ L_s^{⊗m})`

is a polynomial in `m` by Snapper's Lemma; the polynomial coefficients
depend on `s` through the fiber `F|_{X_s}`. When `F` is `S`-flat the
function `s ↦ Φ_{F,s}` is locally constant on `S`.

iter-177+: the body unfolds to the graded-Euler-characteristic
construction once `χ` of a coherent sheaf on a noetherian scheme +
Snapper's polynomial-eventually-property are in scope. For the iter-176
file-skeleton the body is a typed `sorry`. -/

/-! ## §2. The Quot functor

The Quot functor `Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S}` sends an `S`-scheme `T ⟶ S` to the
set of equivalence classes `⟨F, q⟩` of pairs `(F, q)` where
- `F` is a coherent sheaf on `X_T = X ×_S T` whose schematic support is
  proper over `T` and which is `T`-flat,
- `q : E_T ↠ F` is a surjective `O_{X_T}`-linear homomorphism,
- the fiberwise Hilbert polynomial of `F|_{X_t}` with respect to `L|_{X_t}`
  equals `Φ` at every `t ∈ T`.

Two pairs `(F, q)` and `(F', q')` are equivalent iff `ker(q) = ker(q')`.

The Hilbert scheme is the special case `E = O_X`:
`Hilb^{Φ,L}_{X/S} = Quot^{Φ,L}_{O_X/X/S}`.

`S`-scheme `T → S` (i.e. an object of `Over S`) to the set of
equivalence classes `⟨F, q⟩` of pairs `(F, q)` of a `T`-flat coherent
sheaf `F` on `X ×_S T` with proper support and a surjection
`q : E_T ↠ F` whose fiberwise Hilbert polynomial is `Φ`, modulo
`ker(q) = ker(q')`. Functoriality is pullback of the quotient along
`X ×_S T' ⟶ X ×_S T`.

`Scheme.Modules.pullback` bifunctor on the relative product
`X ×_S T`, with the equivalence relation `ker(q) = ker(q')` quotiented

/-! ## §3. The Grassmannian scheme

Since Mathlib carries no Grassmannian *scheme*, we encode it here as a
contravariant functor on `Over S` together with a representability
statement. The construction proceeds by gluing `binom(r, d)` affine
charts `U^I ≅ A^{d(r-d)}_S` along the Plücker cocycle, yielding a smooth
projective `S`-scheme `Gr_S(V, d)` of relative dimension `d(r-d)`,
equipped with a tautological rank-`d` quotient
`π* V ↠ U` and the Plücker closed embedding into `ℙ_S(⋀^d V)`.

`E = V`, constant Hilbert polynomial `d`).

/-- **Representability of the Grassmannian.**

For a noetherian scheme `S`, a locally free `O_S`-module `V` of rank `r`,
and `1 ≤ d ≤ r`, the Grassmannian functor `Grass(V, d)` of
`Grassmannian` is representable by a smooth projective `S`-scheme
`Gr_S(V, d) ⟶ S` of relative dimension `d(r-d)`, equipped with a
tautological rank-`d` quotient `π* V ↠ U`. The determinant line bundle
`det(U)` is relatively very ample, giving a Plücker closed embedding
`Gr_S(V, d) ↪ ℙ_S(⋀^d V)`.

We package the conclusion as the existence of a representing
`Y : Over S` together with a `Functor.RepresentableBy Y` witness for
`Grassmannian V d`; the additional projective / smooth / Plücker
structure is implicit in the construction and is iter-177+ refinement
work (once the proof body lands).

iter-177+: the body follows Nitsure §1 "Construction of Grassmannian":
glue the `binom(r, d)` affine charts `U^I ≅ A^{d(r-d)}_S` along the
Plücker cocycle, verify separatedness via the diagonal cut, verify
properness by the DVR valuative criterion, build the tautological
quotient `U`, exhibit the Plücker embedding via the determinant line
bundle. For the iter-176 file-skeleton the body is a typed `sorry`. -/

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — Quot/Grassmannian predicates

These declarations build the support/freeness predicates of
`blueprint/src/chapters/Picard_QuotScheme.tex`, §"Support and freeness
predicates". Mathlib (at the pinned commit) carries no rank-`d` local
freeness predicate for sheaves of modules on a scheme, so it is built here. -/

/-- **Locally free of rank `d`** for a sheaf of modules on a scheme.

A sheaf of modules `M` on a scheme `X` is *locally free of rank `d`* when `X`
admits an open cover `{U i}` on each member of which the restriction
`M|_{U i}` (the pullback of `M` along the open immersion `(U i).ι`) is
isomorphic to the free module of rank `d`, `O_{U i}^{⊕ d}` (encoded as
`SheafOfModules.free (ULift (Fin d))` over the structure-ring sheaf of the
open subscheme `(U i).toScheme`).

This predicate is project-local: Mathlib does not supply a rank-indexed local
freeness predicate for sheaves of modules on a scheme. Blueprint:

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — annihilator ideal sheaf and schematic support

These declarations build the annihilator ideal sheaf of a sheaf of modules and the
support/properness predicates of `blueprint/src/chapters/Picard_QuotScheme.tex`,
§"Support and freeness predicates". Mathlib (at the pinned commit) carries no
annihilator ideal sheaf for sheaves of modules on a scheme, nor a schematic-support
or proper-support predicate, so they are built here.

The annihilator is packaged via `Scheme.IdealSheafData.ofIdeals`, exactly mirroring
Mathlib's `Scheme.Hom.ker` (which is `ofIdeals fun U ↦ RingHom.ker (f.app U).hom`):
`ofIdeals` produces *the largest ideal sheaf contained in* an arbitrary affine-local
family of ideals, so the structure's `map_ideal_basicOpen` coherence is discharged
internally and need not be supplied at definition time. The basic-open coherence that
makes the local annihilators agree with `ofIdeals` (the analogue of `Hom.ker_apply`,
`def:modules_annihilator`) is the separate characterization lemma `annihilator_ideal`,
which depends on the not-yet-closed QCoh→localization bridge
`isLocalizedModule_basicOpen` (`lem:qcoh_section_localization_basicOpen`) together with
the algebra engine `Module.annihilator_isLocalizedModule_eq_map`
(`lem:annihilator_localization_eq_map`); see the handoff in
`task_results/.../QuotScheme.md`. -/

On each affine open `U`, the intended section is the annihilator

in that affine-local family — exactly the construction used for `Scheme.Hom.ker`. This
sidesteps proving the basic-open coherence (`map_ideal_basicOpen`) at definition time;
the identity `(annihilator F).ideal U = Ann_{Γ(X,U)}(Γ(F,U))` is the downstream
characterization lemma (`annihilator_ideal`, blocked on the QCoh localization bridge).

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — annihilator under localization

The annihilator ideal sheaf `def:modules_annihilator` of a coherent sheaf is
built from the affine-local data `U ↦ Ann_{O(U)}(F(U))`, packaged as a
`Scheme.IdealSheafData`. The structure's coherence field `map_ideal_basicOpen`
requires the algebraic fact that, for a *finitely generated* module, the
annihilator commutes with localization:
`Ann(S⁻¹M) = (Ann M)·S⁻¹R`. Mathlib (at the pinned commit) does not carry this
lemma, so it is supplied here as the load-bearing engine for that construction.
-/

namespace Module

/-- For a finitely generated module `M` over a commutative ring `R`, the
annihilator commutes with localization: if `Rₚ` localizes `R` at a submonoid
`S` and `f : M →ₗ[R] Mₚ` localizes `M` at `S`, then the annihilator of `Mₚ`
over `Rₚ` is the extension (`Ideal.map` along `algebraMap R Rₚ`) of the
annihilator of `M` over `R`.

This is the abstract `IsLocalization`/`IsLocalizedModule` form, matching the
shape needed for the affine-basic-open coherence of the annihilator ideal sheaf
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.annihilator`, `def:modules_annihilator`):
the structure-sheaf restriction `Γ(X,U) → Γ(X, D(f))` is
`IsLocalization (powers f)`, and for a quasi-coherent `F` the section
restriction is `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)`.

Mathlib has no annihilator-localization lemma, so this is project-local. -/

/-! ### Ambient subquotient induction for Stacks 00K1

The Route-2 graded-module side of the inductive step. Everything is phrased over a
**fixed** ambient graded `κ`-module `M = ⨁ ℳ n`: a subquotient is a pair of homogeneous
submodules `N' ≤ N ⊆ M`, and its Hilbert function is the ambient dimension difference
`n ↦ dim_κ(N ⊓ ℳ n) − dim_κ(N' ⊓ ℳ n)`. The kernel and cokernel of a degree-one
endomorphism are again ambient subquotient pairs, so no `DirectSum.Decomposition` on a
quotient/subtype carrier is ever formed (cf.
`memory/graded-quotient-module-isdefeq-pathology.md`). -/

A finite family `t : Fin r → End κ M` of pairwise-commuting `κ`-linear endomorphisms makes `M`
a module over the **free** polynomial ring `MvPolynomial (Fin r) κ`, with `X i` acting as
`t i`. The free polynomial ring — not the subalgebra `Algebra.adjoin κ (range t)` — is used so
that the inductive transfer (`subquotient_finite_transfer`) has the ring surjection
`MvPolynomial (Fin (r+1)) κ ↠ MvPolynomial (Fin r) κ` available; relations among the `t i`
inside `End κ M` would obstruct the analogous surjection of subalgebras. -/

/-! ### The ambient subquotient datum

Bundles a homogeneous pair `N' ≤ N` of a fixed graded `κ`-module `M = ⨁ ℳ n` with `r`
pairwise-commuting degree-raising endomorphisms preserving the pair, plus the finiteness of
the represented subquotient `N/N'` over the free polynomial ring `MvPolynomial (Fin r) κ` (via
`polySubmodule`, so the underlying carriers stay ambient submodules of `M`). This is the
length-`r` carrier of the Stacks 00K1 ambient induction (`def:graded_subquotientHilb`). -/

/-- **Graded Hilbert–Serre: rationality of the Hilbert series** (`lem:gradedHilbertSerre_rational`).
For a graded `κ`-module `M = ⨁ ℳ n` with finite-dimensional components, equipped with `r`
pairwise-commuting degree-one endomorphisms (the degree-one generators of the action) for which `M`
is finite over the free polynomial ring `MvPolynomial (Fin r) κ`, the Hilbert function
`n ↦ dim_κ ℳ n` is a rational Hilbert function of order `r`: there are `p ∈ ℚ[X]` and `N` with
`dim_κ ℳ n = [Xⁿ](p · (1 - X)⁻ʳ)` for all `n > N`. This is the substantive (non-Mathlib) half of
graded Hilbert–Serre; it is obtained from the ambient subquotient induction
(`GradedModule.subquotient_hilbertSeries_rational`) applied to the top datum `(⊤, ⊥)`. -/
