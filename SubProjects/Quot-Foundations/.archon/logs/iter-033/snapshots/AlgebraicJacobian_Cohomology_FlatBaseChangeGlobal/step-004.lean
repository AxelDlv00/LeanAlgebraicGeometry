# Flat base change for the pushforward, global (`H⁰`-as-equalizer) chain

This file builds the global ("FBC-B") leg of the `i = 0` flat-base-change package:
`H⁰(X, F) = Γ(X, F)` of a quasi-compact, quasi-separated scheme is the equalizer of
a *finite* affine cover, and flat base change commutes with that finite equalizer.

It is the companion of `AlgebraicJacobian.Cohomology.FlatBaseChange`, which it imports
read-only (using the affine global-sections comparison as a per-term black box).

See `blueprint/src/chapters/Cohomology_FlatBaseChange.tex` (FBC-B section).

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — finite affine covers with quasi-compact overlaps -/

/-- A quasi-compact scheme admits a *finite* affine open cover; when it is moreover
quasi-separated, every pairwise intersection of cover members is quasi-compact.

Project-local: packages `isCompact_iff_finite_and_eq_biUnion_affineOpens` (finite affine
subcover of `⊤`) with `quasiSeparatedSpace_iff_forall_affineOpens` (quasi-compact overlaps)
into the single combinatorial input feeding the finite sheaf-condition equalizer of the
`H⁰` flat-base-change argument. -/
