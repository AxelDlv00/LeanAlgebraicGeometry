# The Quot scheme: Quot-foundations layer

This file packages the Quot-foundations layer of the
Grothendieck–Altman–Kleiman Quot-scheme construction. It introduces the
per-fiber Hilbert polynomial of a coherent sheaf, the Quot functor
`Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S}` of `T`-flat coherent quotients, and the Grassmannian
*scheme* (Mathlib at the pinned commit carries only a linear-algebra
Grassmannian) together with its representability.

The 4 blueprint-pinned declarations are:

1. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.hilbertPolynomial` (def) — the
   **Hilbert polynomial function** `s ↦ Φ_{F,s} ∈ ℚ[λ]` of a coherent
   sheaf `F` on `X` over a finite-type `π : X ⟶ S` with respect to a
   line bundle `L`. Encoded as a function `S → Polynomial ℚ`.

2. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.QuotFunctor` (def) — the **Quot
   functor** `Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S} : (Sch/S)^op ⥤ Set` sending an
   `S`-scheme `T ⟶ S` to the set of equivalence classes
   `⟨F, q⟩` of pairs `(F, q)` with `F` a `T`-flat coherent sheaf on
   `X_T`, `q : E_T ↠ F` a surjection, and `F|_{X_t}` having Hilbert
   polynomial `Φ` at every `t ∈ T`.

3. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Grassmannian` (def) — the
   **Grassmannian functor** `Grass(V, d) : (Sch/S)^op ⥤ Set` of
   rank-`d` quotients of a locally free `O_S`-module `V`.

4. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Grassmannian.representable` (theorem)
   — the **representability of the Grassmannian** by a smooth projective
   `S`-scheme `Gr_S(V, d)` of relative dimension `d(r-d)`, equipped with
   the Plücker closed embedding into `ℙ_S(⋀^d V)`.

## Note on type expressivity

Following the project rule "Never weaken the type to dodge the proof",
each declaration carries a substantive, non-tautological type:

- `hilbertPolynomial` returns `Polynomial ℚ` keyed by `s : S`, not
  `Unit`; the Hilbert polynomial is a non-trivial invariant of the
  coherent sheaf at the fiber over `s`.
- `QuotFunctor` and `Grassmannian` return contravariant functors into
  `Type u` — substantive presheaves of sets, not constant functors.
- `Grassmannian.representable` packages the
  `Functor.RepresentableBy` Yoneda-bijection structure: existence of a
  scheme `Y` together with a `RepresentableBy Y` witness — substantive
  content (a representable functor is determined by its representing
  object up to canonical isomorphism, and the witness is the data of
  that isomorphism family).

## Mathlib status

Mathlib (master `b80f227`) provides:
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules` (the category `X.Modules`),
- `Scheme.Modules.pullback`, `Scheme.Modules.pushforward` (the
  pullback–pushforward adjunction at level `i = 0`),
- `CategoryTheory.Functor.RepresentableBy` for representable functors,
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyOfFiniteType`, `AlgebraicGeometry.IsLocallyNoetherian`
  (morphism / object property predicates), and
- `Polynomial` for `ℚ[λ]`.

Mathlib does NOT provide (at the pinned commit):
- a Grassmannian *scheme* (only a linear-algebra Grassmannian
  as a finite-rank-quotient variety),
- the Quot/Hilbert functor or its representability,
- Snapper's Lemma for the polynomial property of Euler characteristics.

/-! ## §1. Hilbert polynomial of a coherent sheaf

For a finite-type morphism `π : X ⟶ S` with `S` noetherian and a coherent
sheaf `F` on `X` whose schematic support is proper over `S` (here encoded
as plain `X.Modules` for the file-skeleton), the per-fiber Hilbert
polynomial is the function

`s ↦ Φ_{F,s} ∈ ℚ[λ],   Φ_{F,s}(m) = χ(X_s, F|_{X_s} ⊗ L_s^{⊗m})`.

Snapper's Lemma ensures this is a polynomial in `m`; the proof requires
graded-Euler-characteristic infrastructure and is not stated here.

Blueprint reference: `def:hilbert_polynomial` (Nitsure §1; cf. Hartshorne
III.5.2). -/

/-- The **Hilbert polynomial** of a coherent sheaf `F` on `X` over `S` at
the fiber over `s ∈ S` with respect to a line bundle `L` on `X`.

Encoded as a function `s ↦ Φ_{F,s} ∈ ℚ[λ]`. The defining formula

`Φ_{F,s}(m) = χ(X_s, F|_{X_s} ⊗ L_s^{⊗ m})
            = Σ_i (-1)^i dim_{κ(s)} H^i(X_s, F|_{X_s} ⊗ L_s^{⊗m})`

is a polynomial in `m` by Snapper's Lemma; the polynomial coefficients
depend on `s` through the fiber `F|_{X_s}`. When `F` is `S`-flat the
function `s ↦ Φ_{F,s}` is locally constant on `S`.

construction once `χ` of a coherent sheaf on a noetherian scheme +

/-! ## §2. The Quot functor

The Quot functor `Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S}` sends an `S`-scheme `T ⟶ S` to the
set of equivalence classes `⟨F, q⟩` of pairs `(F, q)` where
- `F` is a coherent sheaf on `X_T = X ×_S T` whose schematic support is
  proper over `T` and which is `T`-flat,
- `q : E_T ↠ F` is a surjective `O_{X_T}`-linear homomorphism,
- the fiberwise Hilbert polynomial of `F|_{X_t}` with respect to `L|_{X_t}`
  equals `Φ` at every `t ∈ T`.

Two pairs `(F, q)` and `(F', q')` are equivalent iff `ker(q) = ker(q')`.

The Hilbert scheme is the special case `E = O_X`:
`Hilb^{Φ,L}_{X/S} = Quot^{Φ,L}_{O_X/X/S}`.

`S`-scheme `T → S` (i.e. an object of `Over S`) to the set of
equivalence classes `⟨F, q⟩` of pairs `(F, q)` of a `T`-flat coherent
sheaf `F` on `X ×_S T` with proper support and a surjection
`q : E_T ↠ F` whose fiberwise Hilbert polynomial is `Φ`, modulo
`ker(q) = ker(q')`. Functoriality is pullback of the quotient along

/-! ## §3. The Grassmannian scheme

Since Mathlib carries no Grassmannian *scheme*, we encode it here as a
contravariant functor on `Over S` together with a representability
statement. The construction proceeds by gluing `binom(r, d)` affine
charts `U^I ≅ A^{d(r-d)}_S` along the Plücker cocycle, yielding a smooth
projective `S`-scheme `Gr_S(V, d)` of relative dimension `d(r-d)`,
equipped with a tautological rank-`d` quotient
`π* V ↠ U` and the Plücker closed embedding into `ℙ_S(⋀^d V)`.

/-- **Representability of the Grassmannian.**

For a noetherian scheme `S`, a locally free `O_S`-module `V` of rank `r`,
and `1 ≤ d ≤ r`, the Grassmannian functor `Grass(V, d)` of
`Grassmannian` is representable by a smooth projective `S`-scheme
`Gr_S(V, d) ⟶ S` of relative dimension `d(r-d)`, equipped with a
tautological rank-`d` quotient `π* V ↠ U`. The determinant line bundle
`det(U)` is relatively very ample, giving a Plücker closed embedding
`Gr_S(V, d) ↪ ℙ_S(⋀^d V)`.

We package the conclusion as the existence of a representing
`Y : Over S` together with a `Functor.RepresentableBy Y` witness for
`Grassmannian V d`; the additional projective / smooth / Plücker
structure is implicit in the construction and is iter-177+ refinement
work (once the proof body lands).

Plücker cocycle, verify separatedness via the diagonal cut, verify
properness by the DVR valuative criterion, build the tautological

bundle. For the iter-176 file-skeleton the body is a typed `sorry`. -/

These declarations build the support/freeness predicates of

freeness predicate for sheaves of modules on a scheme, so it is built here. -/

/-- **Locally free of rank `d`** for a sheaf of modules on a scheme.

A sheaf of modules `M` on a scheme `X` is *locally free of rank `d`* when `X`
admits an open cover `{U i}` on each member of which the restriction
`M|_{U i}` (the pullback of `M` along the open immersion `(U i).ι`) is
isomorphic to the free module of rank `d`, `O_{U i}^{⊕ d}` (encoded as
`SheafOfModules.free (ULift (Fin d))` over the structure-ring sheaf of the
open subscheme `(U i).toScheme`).

This predicate is project-local: Mathlib does not supply a rank-indexed local
freeness predicate for sheaves of modules on a scheme. Blueprint:

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — annihilator ideal sheaf and schematic support

These declarations build the annihilator ideal sheaf of a sheaf of modules and the
support/properness predicates of `blueprint/src/chapters/Picard_QuotScheme.tex`,
§"Support and freeness predicates". Mathlib (at the pinned commit) carries no
annihilator ideal sheaf for sheaves of modules on a scheme, nor a schematic-support
or proper-support predicate, so they are built here.

The annihilator is packaged via `Scheme.IdealSheafData.ofIdeals`, exactly mirroring
Mathlib's `Scheme.Hom.ker` (which is `ofIdeals fun U ↦ RingHom.ker (f.app U).hom`):
`ofIdeals` produces *the largest ideal sheaf contained in* an arbitrary affine-local
family of ideals, so the structure's `map_ideal_basicOpen` coherence is discharged
internally and need not be supplied at definition time. The basic-open coherence that
makes the local annihilators agree with `ofIdeals` (the analogue of `Hom.ker_apply`,
`def:modules_annihilator`) is the separate characterization lemma `annihilator_ideal`,
which depends on the not-yet-closed QCoh→localization bridge
`isLocalizedModule_basicOpen` (`lem:qcoh_section_localization_basicOpen`) together with
the algebra engine `Module.annihilator_isLocalizedModule_eq_map`
(`lem:annihilator_localization_eq_map`); see the handoff in

sidesteps proving the basic-open coherence (`map_ideal_basicOpen`) at definition time;
the identity `(annihilator F).ideal U = Ann_{Γ(X,U)}(Γ(F,U))` is the downstream

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — annihilator under localization

The annihilator ideal sheaf `def:modules_annihilator` of a coherent sheaf is
built from the affine-local data `U ↦ Ann_{O(U)}(F(U))`, packaged as a
`Scheme.IdealSheafData`. The structure's coherence field `map_ideal_basicOpen`
requires the algebraic fact that, for a *finitely generated* module, the
annihilator commutes with localization:
`Ann(S⁻¹M) = (Ann M)·S⁻¹R`. Mathlib (at the pinned commit) does not carry this
lemma, so it is supplied here as the load-bearing engine for that construction.
-/

namespace Module

/-- For a finitely generated module `M` over a commutative ring `R`, the
annihilator commutes with localization: if `Rₚ` localizes `R` at a submonoid
`S` and `f : M →ₗ[R] Mₚ` localizes `M` at `S`, then the annihilator of `Mₚ`
over `Rₚ` is the extension (`Ideal.map` along `algebraMap R Rₚ`) of the
annihilator of `M` over `R`.

This is the abstract `IsLocalization`/`IsLocalizedModule` form, matching the
shape needed for the affine-basic-open coherence of the annihilator ideal sheaf
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.annihilator`, `def:modules_annihilator`):
the structure-sheaf restriction `Γ(X,U) → Γ(X, D(f))` is
`IsLocalization (powers f)`, and for a quasi-coherent `F` the section
restriction is `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)`.

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — quasi-coherent sections localize on a basic open

This section builds, bottom-up, toward the keystone
`lem:qcoh_section_localization_basicOpen`: for a quasi-coherent sheaf of modules `M`
on a scheme `X`, an affine open `U`, and `f ∈ Γ(X,U)`, the restriction
`M(U) → M(D(f))` exhibits `M(D(f))` as `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `Γ(X,U)`.

The substance is the affine (Spec-local) computation: over `Spec R`, a quasi-coherent
sheaf is `Ñ = tilde N` for `N = Γ(M)`, and the basic-open restriction of `Ñ` is the
module localization map. Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.tilde` namespace already carries
the localization fact for `tilde N` *as the map out of `N`* (the instance
`IsLocalizedModule (.powers f) (tilde.toOpen N (basicOpen f)).hom`). The first building
block below repackages this as a statement about the *presheaf restriction map* of `Ñ`
itself (from global sections to `D(f)`), which is the form the downstream scheme-level
argument consumes after the affine identification `M|_U ≅ Ñ`.

Mathlib (at the pinned commit) does **not** prove that an arbitrary quasi-coherent sheaf
on `Spec R` lies in the essential image of `tilde` (the comment in
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Modules/Tilde.lean` says this "will later be shown"); the
equivalence `QCoh(Spec R) ≃ Mod R` is a genuine gap. Consequently the keystone for an
*arbitrary* quasi-coherent `M` is gated on that bridge (`IsQuasicoherent M → IsIso
M.fromTildeΓ`); the building blocks here are stated for `tilde N` directly, and for a
general `M : (Spec R).Modules` under the explicit hypothesis `[IsIso M.fromTildeΓ]`
(equivalently, `M` in the essential image of `tilde`). -/

/-- **Basic-open restriction of a `tilde` sheaf is a module localization.**

For `N : ModuleCat R` and `f : R`, the presheaf restriction map of the associated sheaf
`Ñ = tilde N` from global sections `Γ(Ñ, ⊤)` to the basic open `Γ(Ñ, D(f))` exhibits the
latter as `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `R`.

This is the affine, Spec-local heart of `lem:qcoh_section_localization_basicOpen`. Mathlib
carries the localization fact for the map `tilde.toOpen N (D f) : N → Γ(Ñ, D(f))` out of
`N`; since `tilde.toOpen N ⊤ : N → Γ(Ñ, ⊤)` is an isomorphism and
`tilde.toOpen N (D f) = tilde.toOpen N ⊤ ≫ restriction` (`tilde.toOpen_res`), precomposing
the localization map with the inverse isomorphism (`IsLocalizedModule.of_linearEquiv_right`)
transfers the property to the restriction map. Project-local: Mathlib states the fact only

/-- **Basic-open restriction localizes, for a sheaf in the essential image of `tilde`.**

For a sheaf of modules `M` on `Spec R` whose tilde-Gamma counit `M.fromTildeΓ` is an
isomorphism (equivalently, `M` lies in the essential image of the `tilde` functor — the
honest Spec-affine stand-in for quasi-coherence, see the section header), the presheaf
restriction map of `M` from global sections `Γ(M, ⊤)` to the basic open `Γ(M, D(f))`
exhibits the latter as `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `R`.

This transports `isLocalizedModule_tilde_restrict` across the isomorphism
`M.fromTildeΓ : tilde N ⟶ M` (where `N = Γ(M, ⊤)`): the induced presheaf isomorphism is
natural in the open, so on each of `⊤` and `D(f)` it provides an `R`-linear isomorphism
intertwining the two restriction maps. Post- and pre-composing the localization map for
`tilde N` with these isomorphisms (`IsLocalizedModule.of_linearEquiv`,
`IsLocalizedModule.of_linearEquiv_right`) yields the property for `M`.

Project-local: it is the affine engine of `lem:qcoh_section_localization_basicOpen`. The
general quasi-coherent case additionally requires the (currently Mathlib-absent) bridge
`IsQuasicoherent M → IsIso M.fromTildeΓ`. -/

/-- **`IsIso M.fromTildeΓ` from per-basic-open section localization** (the cheap stalk/section
assembly of `lem:qcoh_affine_isIso_fromTildeΓ`, the blueprint "G1-assemble" step). If for every
`f : R` the section restriction `Γ(M, ⊤) → Γ(M, D(f))` of a sheaf of modules `M` on `Spec R`
exhibits the target as `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `R` — exactly the conclusion of G1-core
(`lem:qcoh_affine_section_localization`,
`isLocalizedModule_basicOpen_of_isQuasicoherent`) — then the tilde-Gamma counit `M.fromTildeΓ` is
an isomorphism (equivalently `M` lies in the essential image of `tilde`).

On each basic open `D(f)` the component of `modulesSpecToSheaf.map M.fromTildeΓ` is a map between
two localizations of `N = Γ(M, ⊤)` at `powers f`: the source `Γ(tilde N, D(f))` localizes via the
instance `tilde.toOpen N (D f)` and the target `Γ(M, D(f))` localizes by hypothesis, and the two
localization maps are intertwined by `Scheme.Modules.toOpen_fromTildeΓ_app`. Hence the component is
the canonical localization isomorphism (`IsLocalizedModule.linearEquiv`);
`isIso_sheaf_of_isIso_app_basicOpen` upgrades this to an isomorphism of sheaves, and
`modulesSpecToSheaf` being fully faithful reflects it to `IsIso M.fromTildeΓ`.

This turns the remaining keystone obligation into exactly G1-core: combined with the converse engine
`isLocalizedModule_restrict_of_isIso_fromTildeΓ`, the per-basic-open localization hypothesis is
*equivalent* to `IsIso M.fromTildeΓ`. Project-local: Mathlib has no `IsQuasicoherent → IsIso

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — G1-core (Route F) building blocks

The keystone G1-core `lem:qcoh_affine_section_localization` asks: for a *quasi-coherent*
`M : (Spec R).Modules` and `f : R`, the section restriction `Γ(M,⊤) → Γ(M,D(f))` is
`IsLocalizedModule (powers f)`. Via `isIso_fromTildeΓ_iff_isLocalizedModule_restrict` this is
*equivalent* to `IsIso M.fromTildeΓ` — i.e. to the statement that a quasi-coherent sheaf on an
affine scheme lies in the essential image of `tilde` (the `QCoh(Spec R) ≃ Mod R` equivalence). That
equivalence is a genuine Mathlib gap at the pinned commit (Tilde.lean only proves the *globally
presented* case, `isIso_fromTildeΓ_of_presentation`).

The composition lemma below discharges the **globally-presented** sub-case end to end (it is the
Route-F endpoint once a global presentation/tilde identification is in hand). The residual gap is
exactly the production of a global presentation/tilde from local (quasi-coherent) data on `Spec R`;
see the handoff in `task_results/.../QuotScheme.md`. -/

/-- **Basic-open restriction localizes, for a globally presented module.** If `M : (Spec R).Modules`
admits a global `SheafOfModules.Presentation`, then for every `f : R` the section restriction
`Γ(M,⊤) → Γ(M,D(f))` exhibits the target as `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `R`.

This is the composition of Mathlib's `isIso_fromTildeΓ_of_presentation` (a global presentation
forces `M.fromTildeΓ` to be an isomorphism, i.e. `M` is a `tilde`) with the affine engine
`isLocalizedModule_restrict_of_isIso_fromTildeΓ`. It is the Route-F endpoint for the
globally-presented case; the general quasi-coherent case additionally requires producing a global
presentation/tilde identification from the (Mathlib-absent) affine `QCoh(Spec R) ≃ Mod R` bridge.
