# Grassmannian affine charts

This file contains the single blueprint-pinned declaration for the affine
charts of the Grassmannian scheme: `AlgebraicGeometry.Grassmannian.affineChart`.

For `I ⊆ Fin r` with `#I = d`, the affine chart `U^I` of the Grassmannian
`Gr(d, r)` is the spectrum of the polynomial ring in the `d(r-d)` free matrix
entries — `Spec ℤ[x^I_{p,q}]_{q ∉ I}` — which is non-canonically isomorphic
to `𝔸^{d(r-d)}_ℤ`.

/- Planner note:
   Blueprint `def:gr_affine_chart` (Nitsure §1, "Construction by gluing together
   affine patches"): for `I ⊆ {1..r}` with `#I = d`, `X^I` is the `d×r` matrix
   whose `I`-minor is the `d×d` identity and whose other `d(r-d)` entries are
   independent indeterminates `x^I_{p,q}` over ℤ. The affine chart is
   `U^I := Spec ℤ[X^I] = Spec (MvPolynomial (Fin d × {q : Fin r // q ∉ I}) ℤ)` —
   the spectrum of the polynomial ring on the `d(r-d)` free entries; non-canonically
   `≅ 𝔸^{d(r-d)}_ℤ`. The prover should build `affineChart` as
   `AlgebraicGeometry.Spec` of that `CommRingCat` (the MvPolynomial ring on the
   free-entry index type), via
   `MvPolynomial (Fin d × {q // q ∉ I}) ℤ` or an equivalent index of cardinality
   `d(r-d)`. -/

/-- The **affine chart** `U^I` of the Grassmannian `Gr(d, r)` indexed by a
`d`-element subset `I : Finset (Fin r)`.

Concretely `U^I = Spec ℤ[x^I_{p,q}]_{p : Fin d, q ∉ I}`, the spectrum of the
polynomial ring `MvPolynomial (Fin d × {q : Fin r // q ∉ I}) ℤ` in the `d(r-d)`
free entries of the standard matrix representative with `I`-minor equal to the
identity. This chart is non-canonically isomorphic to `𝔸^{d(r-d)}_ℤ`.

The Grassmannian scheme is obtained by gluing the `Nat.choose r d` affine charts
`U^I` along the Plücker cocycle transition maps.

iter-177+: the body should be
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Spec (CommRingCat.of (MvPolynomial (Fin d × {q : Fin r // q ∉ I}) ℤ))`.
For the iter-007 file-skeleton the body is a typed `sorry`. -/
