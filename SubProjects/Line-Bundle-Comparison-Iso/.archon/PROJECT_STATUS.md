# Project Status

This file was reset on extraction into the **Line-Bundle Comparison Iso**
subproject. The parent's accumulated iteration narrative (iter-099…iter-303,
much of it about files now out of scope) was dropped; this subproject's own
`archon` run regenerates status as it makes progress. Per-iter narrative lives
in `iter/iter-NNN/review.md`; this file carries the cumulative Knowledge Base only.

Current scope and live state live in [`PROGRESS.md`](PROGRESS.md) and
[`STRATEGY.md`](STRATEGY.md). Summary:

- **Seeds:** `lem:pullback_tensor_iso_loctriv`, `lem:dual_isLocallyTrivial`,
  `thm:rel_pic_addcommgroup_via_tensorobj` (108-node cone).
- **Open targets (post iter-017):** TensorObjSubstrate.lean GREEN, 2 sorries —
  `exists_tensorObj_inverse` (L719, import-cycle, deferred) and `pullbackTensorMap_restrict`
  (decl L3144; residual `hcore2` at L3626). Steps (i) [iter-015], (ii) [iter-016 `sheafifyMap_δcomp_split`],
  and (iii)-a/b.1/b.2 [iter-017, the S1^h slide + prefix-cancel + slide-of-V] all CLOSED+spliced. **Residual
  = `hcore2` only:** the folded Sq3/Sq4 **presheaf** identity (D1′-level chase). Sq3/Sq4 are NOT built
  standalone (`sheafifyTensorUnitIso_comp`/`pullbackValIso_comp` are orphaned blueprint targets, merged
  into `hcore2`). `sheafificationCompPullback_comp_tail`/`_comp`/`_comp_natTrans`/`hδ` CLOSED iter-006.
  **DualInverse/SliceTransport.lean GREEN, 0 sorries — DUAL route CLOSED** (`sliceDualTransport` incl.
  left_inv/right_inv proved, axiom-clean). Full chain builds green together.
- **Stage:** prover.

## Knowledge Base

### Proof Patterns (reusable across targets)
- **Unit-naturality fold + generic-`exact` device (the D3′ Sq4 leaf unblock — CLOSED iter-019):** for a
  goal carrying leading sheafification units (`η`) + `forget` over the `SheafOfModules` carrier, apply
  `η` unit naturality on EACH leg to factor out a common leading `η ≫ forget(·)`, collapsing to a clean
  carrier-level cocycle. Then `slice_lhs`/`slice_rhs` to align and `exact comp_forget_cocycle (forget …) …`
  — a generic single-`[Category C]` lemma applied by `exact` (the documented instance-crossing device:
  `rw`/`simp`/`erw`/`reassoc_of%` ALL whnf-bomb on the `Sheaf.val`↔`ObjectProperty.obj` deprecated-alias
  defeq boundary, even plain `Category.assoc`/`← Functor.map_comp`). ⚠ pass `forget` EXPLICITLY (else
  "typeclass instance problem is stuck"). Sub-coherences likewise as generic helpers by `exact`:
  `inv_telescope` (3-pair iso telescope, replaces failing `simp`), `cocycle_assemble` (cocycle skeleton).
  The (T) adjunction triangle `L.map(η ≫ R k) ≫ ε = k` is cleanest as the TERM `(adj.homEquiv P M).left_inv k`
  (NOT `left_triangle_components`/`homEquiv_unit` rewriting). Name-clash: bare `Functor.map_id` in `rw` can
  hit the Haskell `Functor` → use `CategoryTheory.Functor.map_id`. `set b := …` to localize a `pullbackValIso`
  unfold so `simp only [pullbackValIso, Iso.trans_hom, …]` rewrites only the targeted legs.
- **Composite-adjunction cocycle at the NatTrans level (the D3′ keystone — CLOSED iter-006):** prove
  the whole-transformation equation, NOT the `.app P` component — the dependent `eqToHom`/reindex junk
  that blocks every `rw` exists ONLY post-`.app`. Build it from `Adjunction.leftAdjointCompNatTrans_assoc`
  (Mathlib `CompositionIso.lean`) instances with outer comparisons trivialized via `conjugateEquiv_symm_id`;
  evaluate `.app P` exactly ONCE at the end. To close a *consumer* (`comp_tail`): take the `P`-component
  of the NatTrans lemma (= the caller's statement), transpose FORWARD via `homEquiv`, and replay the
  caller's reduction script **`at` the hypothesis** (not the goal). Mirrors the project's own working
  `pullbackObjUnitToUnit_comp`. Recipe: `analogies/d3cocycle006.md`.
- **`erw` for cross-elaboration / `Sheaf.val`-spelled / `show`-pinned rewrites (D3′ region):** a term
  elaborated standalone (e.g. simp lemma `J1`, a `show`-pinned `δfh`) carries a hidden instance-level
  defeq mismatch with the same term elaborated inside a `leftAdjointCompNatTrans_assoc` paste —
  `rw`/`simp only` silently no-op (watch for the unused-simp-arg warning); `erw` defeq-matches. The
  leftover `𝟙`-junk sits at a defeq-but-not-syntactic object spelling, so `Category.id_comp` also needs
  `erw`. ⚠ `erw [Functor.map_comp]` on an oplax `δ` catastrophically UNFOLDS it into its mate expansion —
  never. To fold instead, `rw [← Functor.map_comp]` (explicit `aZ.map _ ≫ aZ.map _` heads match) then
  `exact congrArg aZ.map …`. Pre-elaborate context-sensitive instances (`IsLocallyInjective (𝟙 …)`)
  via a private abbrev (`sheafifyIdOf`) so a multi-scheme statement doesn't re-run synthesis.
- **Thin-poset `subsingleton` close (dual-valued only):** an `isoMk` naturality square whose
  connecting Hom-space is *dual-valued* (maps into the unit) over a thin poset (`Opens Y`) is a
  `Subsingleton`; `subsingleton` closes it in one line (e.g. `dual_restrict_iso` isoMk naturality,
  DualInverse ~L786). ⚠ It does NOT close a square whose codomain is a *restriction of the unit*
  (`sliceDualTransport.naturality` L553, `sliceDualTransportInv.naturality` L407) — that codomain is
  not a Subsingleton; `subsingleton` errors `could not synthesize Subsingleton (… ⟶ …)`. The two
  cases look identical but differ in codomain. Verify the instance is genuine (not sorry-induced)
  before trusting an opaque `subsingleton`; prefer `exact Subsingleton.elim _ _`.
- **Slice-transport naturality via pointwise `_apply` rotation (CONFIRMED iter-007 — closed the
  forward `sliceDualTransport.toFun.naturality`; OVERTURNS the old `restrictScalarsLaxε` recipe):**
  the naturality field reduces (via `intro …; apply ModuleCat.hom_ext; refine LinearMap.ext fun z => ?_`)
  to a pointwise ε-commutation equation. Do NOT close it with a `restrictScalarsLaxε` natTrans (the
  prover never found/used one). Instead: (1) EXTRACT a standalone sorry-free lemma
  `sliceDualTransport_naturality_apply` — the parent def is at its heartbeat limit, so it cannot be
  proved inline; (2) close the square pointwise via `appIso_hom_naturality_apply` (ring-level
  naturality of `(f.appIso).hom`) + `dualUnitRingSwap_apply`/`dualUnitRingSwapHom_apply` (the `inv ε`
  legs evaluated WITHOUT `whnf`) + `PresheafOfModules.naturality_apply` of the dual section at the
  `f`-image of `f₁`; (3) delegate the field to it. The inv direction (`sliceDualTransportInv`) is the
  mirror — same extraction, plus `unitRelabelSwap` for the codomain unit and the `hβ` ring-compat
  hyp discharged by `Iso.hom_inv_id`. ⚠ Applying `inv ε` pointwise through `whnf` reproduces the
  ≥6-iter deterministic-timeout (seen again iter-007) — always route through the proven `_apply` lemmas.
- **Composite-adjunction-unit cocycle (do not fine-grain):** `sheafificationCompPullback_comp_tail`
  is an irreducible mate-assembly; whiskered comparison factors (`(pullback h)`-whiskered /
  `forget`-wrapped) expose no `homEquiv` head for `leftAdjointUniqUnitEta_app`. Consume the staged
  `hwr` (`conjugateEquiv_whiskerRight`) via the surjective/injective reduction of
  `leftAdjointCompNatTrans_assoc` (`CompositionIso.lean:155`), mirroring Mathlib's
  `SheafOfModules.pullback_assoc`. ~40–60 LOC; a cross-domain escalation, not a helper round.
- **Unit-swap pointwise helper:** `dualUnitRingSwap_apply` proves
  `(dualUnitRingSwap f W').hom x = (Scheme.Hom.appIso f W').hom.hom x` by composing with the inverse
  appIso map and using injectivity + `hom_inv_id`. Use this helper rather than unfolding the lax unit
  inside large structure fields.
- **Reassociate mate-morphism composites at the NatTrans level, NEVER at `.app` level (iter-014):** the
  `.app` of a `mateEquiv`/`leftAdjointUniq` iso composite is a non-canonical `CategoryStruct.comp` —
  `Category.assoc` cannot key-match it (`rw` "did not find", `simp only` "no progress") and `erw` crosses
  it only by whnf-unfolding the mate machinery, which deterministically bombs (3.2M heartbeats) after a
  few crossings. Move the reassociation BEFORE `.app` (work with the NatTrans/`_comp_natTrans` form) where
  the composite is canonical, then evaluate `.app` exactly once. Same lesson as the D3′ cocycle keystone.
  Also: `rw [lemma]` ≠ `erw [lemma]` when the lemma RHS pretty-prints identically to the goal but carries
  a hidden defeq instance — only `erw` splices (D3′ `erw [h1]`).
- **Strip a `restrictScalars` functor wrapper by defeq (iter-014):** use `erw`/`show` to see through
  `(restrictScalars g).map h |>.hom x = h.hom x`, NOT `rw [ModuleCat.restrictScalars.map_apply]` (the
  latter is pattern-fragile and "did not find pattern"; it was the DUAL `left_inv` L890 bug).
- **D3 associativity scaffold:** For `sheafificationCompPullback_comp`, instantiate
  `Adjunction.leftAdjointCompNatTrans_assoc` with `τ012`/`τ013` identity-shaped forget/pushforward
  comparisons, `τ123 = SheafOfModules.pushforwardComp.inv`, `τ023` the forget-whiskered
  `PresheafOfModules.pushforwardComp.inv`, and `hτ := by ext A; rfl`. Pin pushforward universes as
  `.{u}`; `Adjunction` has no `.right`/`.rightAdjoint` projection.

- **Cross a defeq-but-not-syntactic instance boundary by a generic single-instance lemma + `exact`
  (iter-015 — CLOSED D3′ step (i), the wall of iters 012–015; OVERTURNS the iter-014 "refactor to NatTrans
  level" prescription):** when two morphisms join through a `CategoryStruct.comp` whose two sides carry
  defeq-but-spelled-differently instances (the `Scheme.Modules`-vs-`SheafOfModules` / `pullback φ_{h≫f}`-vs-
  `pullback(φf≫wh)` family), NO `rw`-based reassociation key-matches the boundary and `erw [Category.assoc]`
  whnf-unfolds the `mateEquiv`/`TwoSquare` guts and bombs (3.2M heartbeats). FIX: state the
  reassociation/cancellation as a GENERIC single-instance lemma (`comp_cancel_mid`:
  `(r0≫r1≫r5≫d)≫e≫rest = r0≫r1≫r5≫rest` given `d≫e=𝟙`, proved by plain `Category.assoc`) and discharge the
  concrete mixed-instance goal by **`exact`** (defeq unification) — NOT `rw`/`erw`. Also: to make `rw [h1]`
  fire when the lemma-applied instance differs from the goal's, re-state `h1` as `h1'` with a freshly
  elaborated type accepted up to defeq (`have h1' : <LHS verbatim> = <RHS verbatim> := h1`). Then splice the
  packaged brick by `erw [reassoc_of% hmain]`. This is the general tool for any further instance-boundary
  cancellation in the D3′ four-square merge.
- **Inline multi-field `≃ₗ`/structure defs need a raised `maxHeartbeats` (iter-015):** a `(deterministic)
  timeout at elaborator/whnf` on a six-field `≃ₗ` def — even with a *sorry* field present — is a heartbeat
  budget issue (`set_option maxHeartbeats 1600000 in`), NOT a proof gap. Was the real (mis-diagnosed) blocker
  of DUAL `right_inv`. Also the `(Y ≫ e.inv) ≫ e.hom = Y` CommRingCat-composition quirk (both `rw` and
  `simp [Category.assoc, Iso.inv_hom_id]` no-op): close term-mode via
  `(Category.assoc _ _ _).trans ((congrArg (Y ≫ ·) e.inv_hom_id).trans (Category.comp_id _))`; and prefer the
  targeted `rw [eqToHom_map F.op pf]` over `simp only [eqToHom_map]` (which over-collapses sibling factors).

- **`comp_δ` of a composite of oplax functors is DEFINITIONAL (iter-016):** the
  `Functor.OplaxMonoidal.comp` instance sets `δ(F⋙G) := G.map(δ F) ≫ δ G` definitionally, so an
  `a.map (δ (F⋙G) M N)` split closes by `rw [← Functor.map_comp]; congr 1` — `congr 1` finishes by `rfl`,
  no `Functor.OplaxMonoidal.comp_δ` lemma invocation (writing `exact comp_δ …` there is redundant, "No
  goals"). ⚠ Never `erw [Functor.map_comp]` on an oplax δ — it unfolds the mate (catastrophic). To fold,
  `rw [← Functor.map_comp]` (explicit `a.map _ ≫ a.map _` heads match). Stated as `sheafifyMap_δcomp_split`.
- **`reassoc_of%`-splicing a defeq-proved `have` needs the goal-VERBATIM LHS spelling (iter-016):** a slide
  `have hslide := (…naturality …).symm` typechecks against a hand-written goal-spelling type by defeq, but
  `rw`/`erw [reassoc_of% hslide]` then reports `Did not find an occurrence of the pattern` if the goal's
  actual spelling differs (`((F).app P).hom` vs `F.hom.app P`; `Functor.comp_map`-unfolded `G.map(F.map ·)`
  vs `(F⋙G).map ·`). FIX: extract the live goal (forced type-mismatch `exact (rfl : (0:Nat)=0)`) and copy
  the LHS verbatim into the `have`'s type. Do not hand-spell from the naturality lemma's pretty-print.
- **The `comp_cancel_mid`+`exact` device is a FAMILY — the general tool for the whole D3′ merge (iter-017,
  SPLICED steps iii-a/b.1/b.2):** to cross the `SheafOfModules`-vs-`Scheme.Modules` defeq-but-not-syntactic
  instance boundary that whnf-bombs EVERY `simp`/`rw`/`erw` (incl. `reassoc_of%`), state the move as a
  generic single-`[Category C]` lemma whose conclusion MIRRORS the goal's literal `≫`-nesting, and apply it
  by `refine`/`exact` (assignment-only unification). Four landed (`comp_slide_nested` = buried-pair slide;
  `comp_cancel_three_lr` = 3-prefix L/R cancel, leaf defeqs by `rfl` as args — no big-composite whnf;
  `comp_slide_three` = slide-then-cancel skeleton; `map_comp_slide` = merge-then-slide over an abstract
  functor `G`). The associativity/`map_comp` algebra runs on CLEAN ABSTRACT VARS inside the lemma, never on
  the concrete goal. The math content lives in the hypotheses (`hslide`/`hcomb`/`hcore`) passed in, so the
  lemmas are blueprint-EXEMPT (instance-plumbing, like `comp_cancel_mid`). Two concrete gotchas: `⊗ₘ` on a
  `Sheaf.val` carrier can't synthesize the monoidal instance — pin `(C := PresheafOfModules …)`; and
  `a.map_comp _ _` (defeq `exact`) folds `a.map x ≫ a.map y` where `rw [Functor.map_comp]` reports "did not
  find pattern" (the `≫` lives in the `forget₂`-carrier instance).
- **`hcore2` — the folded Sq3/Sq4 presheaf core: CLOSED iter-018.** Fold both sides into ONE `a_Z.map Ψ`
  (`sheafifyTensorUnitIso_hom_eq'` for the S3 legs) via the NEW generic merge lemma **`map_comp4_eq_comp5`**
  (4-vs-5 `F.map`-fold; `refine`, NOT `rw [← Functor.map_comp]` which no-progresses on the `SheafOfModules`
  instance) → presheaf eqn `Ψ_L=Ψ_R` over Z. Close by: a **CONCRETE fully-applied** `have hδnat := δ_natural
  F u v` (OplaxMonoidal instance pinned ONCE via `show … from`; `presheaf_pullback_oplaxmonoidal`) spliced by
  `erw [← reassoc_of% hδnat]` — ⚠ the metavar `erw [reassoc_of% δ_natural]` whnf-times-out (3.2M heartbeats);
  then `congr 1` cancels the shared `δ_h` head; then the NEW generic **`tensorHom_collapse_3_4`** (3-vs-4
  bifunctorial `tensorHom` collapse, `refine` — `simp/rw [tensorHom_comp_tensorHom]` no-progress on the
  non-canonical monoidal instance) → two per-leg identities = `pullbackValIso_comp_leg`.
- **Generic-lemma + `refine`/`exact` is the UNIVERSAL instance-boundary device (now 5-deep across the merge):**
  `comp_cancel_mid`, `comp_slide_nested`/`comp_cancel_three_lr`/`comp_slide_three`/`map_comp_slide` (iter-017),
  `map_comp4_eq_comp5`, `tensorHom_collapse_3_4` (iter-018). State the fold/cancel/collapse as a generic
  single-`[Category C]`/`[MonoidalCategory C]` lemma whose conclusion MIRRORS the goal's literal `≫`-nesting;
  apply by assignment-only unification. Algebra runs on clean abstract vars; math lives in the passed
  hypotheses; all are blueprint-EXEMPT plumbing. Pin `(C := PresheafOfModules (… ⋙ forget₂ …))` for `⊗ₘ`/
  monoidal carriers.
- **Carrier-instance trap (iter-018):** content in the `PresheafOfModules X.ringCatSheaf.obj` carrier CANNOT
  be lifted to a top-level lemma — its `MonoidalCategoryStruct`/`MonoidalCategory` are only synthesizable in
  the `… ⋙ forget₂` spelling, and the in-place proof's `letI := inferInstance` bridges can't live in a
  signature. Keep such reductions in-place. (Killed the `pullbackTensorMap_restrict_core` extraction.) iter-020
  confirms the wall also blocks `Functor.Monoidal.transport` (it needs a functor-level `.Monoidal` instance
  mentioning the non-synthesizable carrier) → see K1 blocker below.
- **D4′ chart-chase to promote a comparison map to an iso (iter-020 — seed-1 assembly):** to show a global
  comparison `δ^f(M,N)` is iso for locally-trivial `M,N`: cover `Y` by `{f⁻¹W y}` for common trivialising
  affine charts `W` (`exists_isAffineOpen_mem_and_subset` + `restrictIsoUnitOfLE`), reduce by
  `isIso_of_isIso_restrict`, then per-chart use the D3′ base-change identity (`pullbackTensorMap_restrict`)
  on BOTH factorisations of `j' ≫ f = g ≫ W.ι` and isolate the wanted middle factor with a generic
  `isIso_of_isIso_comp4_mid` (composite-hyp FIRST, iso proofs as explicit args). ⚠ Nat-iso inverse
  components `(pullbackComp _ _).inv.app T` are NOT found by `inferInstance` → `inferInstanceAs (IsIso
  (((pullbackComp _ _).app T).inv))`; `IsIso (a≫b≫c≫d)` is not auto → chain `IsIso.comp_isIso'`. The
  flanking factors are comparisons along the OPEN-immersion chart inclusions, so the chase bottoms out on
  the open-immersion δ-iso (K1), NOT directly on the unit pair — the unit-pair case (`...unit_isIso` via
  `pullbackTensorMap_natural`) only handles trivial-base modules (helper K2 `...isIso_of_base_unit`).
- **Presheaf-δ-iso via strong-monoidal mate witness (the K1 scaffold — iter-021, PARTIAL):** to show
  `IsIso (Functor.OplaxMonoidal.δ (pullback φ') M.val N.val)` for an open immersion (dodging the
  monoidal-carrier diamond): (STEP A) `apply isIso_pullbackTensorMap_of_isIso_sheafifyDelta` then close the
  sheafify wrapper with `exact Functor.map_isIso _ (…δ…)` — ⚠ pass the `δ` term EXPLICITLY (`[IsIso f]` else
  becomes a metavar); need `haveI hRA : (pushforward φ').IsRightAdjoint` in scope; `δ` only elaborates with a
  fully type-annotated `letI φ' : … := (f.toRingCatSheafHom).hom`, BUT the outer instance must register against
  the LITERAL `(f.toRingCatSheafHom).hom`, not the let-var (zeta mismatch). (STEP B) mirror
  `tensorObj_restrict_iso`: `H1 : pushforward β ≅ pullback φ'` (`hadj.leftAdjointUniq (pullbackPushforwardAdjunction φ')`),
  upgrade `pushforward β` strong-monoidal (`restrictScalarsMonoidalOfBijective`, `β` = sectionwise `f.appIso⁻¹`),
  witness `e := (H1.app (M⊗N)).symm ≪≫ μIsoβ.symm ≪≫ tensorIso (H1.app M) (H1.app N)`; `rw [hcompat]; exact e.isIso_hom`.
  `hcompat : δ = e.hom` transposes by `rw [Adjunction.leftAdjointOplaxMonoidal_δ, Equiv.symm_apply_eq, Adjunction.homEquiv_unit]`
  then `unit_leftAdjointUniq_hom_app`. Residual leaf = the two-monoidal-structures reconciliation (see Known Blockers).
- **Carrier-diamond RESOLVED via defeq-composite re-ascription (iter-023 — broke the 5-iter K1 wall, OVERTURNS
  the iter-018/020/022 "carrier diamond is a hard substrate wall" verdict):** when a goal needs a
  `MonoidalCategory`/`Functor.Monoidal` instance on the BAD carrier `PresheafOfModules X.ringCatSheaf.obj`
  (not synthesizable; the global instance is keyed on `(_ ⋙ forget₂)`), do NOT `letI`/`inferInstanceAs`/
  `transport` the bad instance in (they ADD the bad carrier). Instead **normalize it away**: rewrite the
  off-carrier functor as a DEFEQ COMPOSITE that the global instance fires on syntactically — here
  `Gβ := pushforward₀OfCommRingCat f.opensFunctor X.presheaf ⋙ restrictScalars β'` (its strong tensorator IS
  `μIsoβ`, so `δ Gβ = μIsoβ.inv` by `rfl`) — then re-ascribe every off-carrier term onto the good carrier by
  defeq: `have hadj' : Gβ ⊣ pushforward φ' := hadj`, `have H1' : Gβ ≅ pullback φ' := H1`. Run the mate
  calculus on the unified carrier. ⚠ Rewriting gotchas (the diamond persists at the TACTIC level):
  plain `rw`/`simp only` key-FAIL on the defeq-but-not-syntactic `≫`/tensor instances; full `simp`
  **zeta-unfolds** the carrier-normalizing `let`s and reintroduces the diamond (→ `simp (config := {zeta := false})`);
  `simp` refuses `reassoc_of% hstar` on orientation grounds (→ `erw` is the ONLY tactic that fires `hstar` +
  the trailing `μ_natural`/`hU` steps). This is the general escape for any remaining off-carrier monoidal goal.
- **Data-instance opacity trap — `haveI`/`have` block `exact`/ascription unification (iter-025):** `Monoidal`
  and `Adjunction` are **DATA, not Prop**. A `haveI hMonβ := restrictScalarsMonoidalOfBijective β' hβ` (or
  `have hadj := pushforwardPushforwardAdj …`) makes the value **opaque**; two distinct opaque copies of the
  same data are NOT defeq, so a lemma that *rebuilds* the instance in its statement fails to apply by `exact`
  / type-ascription — it surfaces as a hard **type-mismatch ERROR** (e.g. `η Gβ`/`δ Gβ` mismatch), diagnosable
  by `convert … using 2` splitting into leaf `rfl`-failures. FIX: convert the EXISTING `haveI→letI` / `have→let`
  in place (transparent), so the rebuilt instances reduce to the same value. ⚠ This is SAFE and does NOT
  reintroduce the carrier diamond — the diamond came from introducing a *second* copy via
  `letI`/`inferInstanceAs`/`transport`; making the *existing* one transparent does not. Verified by `δ Gβ =
  μIsoβ.inv := rfl` + the full mate block still compiling.
- **Oplax-monoidal-unit-on-`1` plumbing (K1 η-collapse CLOSED iter-028):** to discharge a goal where the
  oplax unit `η (restrictScalars α)` must send the section ring `1 ↦ 1`, state the helper's unit element
  through the **genuine ring** `(S ⋙ forget₂ CommRingCat RingCat).obj W` — NOT `𝟙_ .obj W` (else `OfNat`/`One`
  won't synthesise). Helper proof = lax `ε(1)=1` (`ModuleCat.restrictScalars_η` + `RingHom.map_one`) then
  `ε ≫ η = 𝟙` via `Functor.Monoidal.ε_η` fed through `show … = 𝟙 _ from … ; rfl`. Close the use site with
  `erw [helper, map_one]; rfl` — the `erw` defeq-matches the `(restrictScalars β').map 𝟙 ≫ η` composite
  against the helper's bare `η`. ⚠ NEVER pre-apply `rw [Functor.map_id]`/`Category.id_comp` (dependent
  motive failure: the `1` argument's type mentions the rewritten object). `ModuleCat.hom_comp_apply` does
  NOT exist (two-step `hom_comp` + `comp_apply`). Recipe: `analogies/eta-plumbing.md`.
- **Carrier-diamond iso-equation collapse (`X.ringCatSheaf.val` vs `X.presheaf ⋙ forget₂` — B2 iter-028):**
  to push a presheaf-level coherence through `sheafification.map` when the middle object carries the
  `forget unit` vs `𝟙_` diamond: `erw [Functor.map_comp]` for the sheafification leg + `exact congrArg (· ≫ _)
  hmap` (defeq-tolerant) for the final collapse. Plain `rw` FAILS on the middle-object diamond. (Used in
  `tensorObjIsoOfIso_comp_unit_iso`.)
- **Contravariant-`symm` leg sidestep (B1 N-leg iter-028):** to produce a `(dualIsoOfIso t).symm`-shaped leg,
  take `congrArg Iso.symm` of the FORWARD identity + `simpa` (with `Iso.trans_symm`/`Iso.symm_symm`), rather
  than rewriting `(dualIsoOfIso t).symm = dualIsoOfIso t.symm`. The latter is DEAD — `Iso.self_symm_id`
  reports "pattern not found" on `dualIsoOfIso (t ≪≫ t.symm)` though the subterm is present.
- **⚠ UNQUALIFIED-NAME SHADOWING = false-green pitfall (iter-029, cost a whole iter + 29 stripped markers):**
  a proof that closes under `lean_diagnostic_messages` (LSP) AND under an isolated `lake env lean <scratch>`
  can STILL fail the real `lake build` of its owning module, when the proof uses an UNQUALIFIED lemma name
  that a project-local declaration shadows ONLY under the full import set. Concrete instance:
  `linearEndo_apply_comm` (DualInverse.lean:219) `rw [← smul_eq_mul, ← map_smul, …]` — `map_smul` resolved to
  the project-local `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.map_smul` instead of `LinearMap.map_smul` (absent from
  the thin scratch's imports) → "did not find an occurrence of the pattern". FIX: always **fully-qualify**
  lemma names in closing rewrites that touch Mathlib generics (`← LinearMap.map_smul`), and VERIFY a closure
  with a real `lake build <Module>` of the owning module, NOT just LSP + a minimal scratch.
- **B1 eval-core ★' `presheafDualUnitIso_naturality` close (iter-029 recipe, honest mod the L219 fix):**
  `apply Iso.ext; apply PresheafOfModules.hom_ext; intro X; apply ModuleCat.hom_ext; ext φ; simp only
  [Iso.trans_hom, PresheafOfModules.comp_app, ModuleCat.hom_comp, LinearMap.comp_apply]` → two defeq `change`s
  reshape to `evalLin φ ((ŝ.app X) 1) = (ŝ.app X) (evalLin φ 1)` → `exact linearEndo_apply_comm _ _` (S-linear
  endos of the regular module `S` commute on `1`; needs `LinearMap.map_smul` qualified).
- **hN N-square close (`dualUnitIso_dualIsoOfIso`, iter-029, verified `goals:[]`):** `apply Iso.ext; unfold

  ⚠ `erw` (NOT `rw`) is required to combine/split the two `sheafification.map` legs (defeq, not syntactic);

- **Pure-tensor μ-value lemma binder trap (iter-029):** a `((LaxMonoidal.μ F M₁ M₂).app W).hom (m ⊗ₜ n) = m ⊗ₜ n`
  lemma elaborates ONLY with ABSTRACT object binders (`M₁ M₂ : PresheafOfModules (T₀ ⋙ forget₂ …)`, `m : M₁.obj W`)
  + `set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in`. Concrete `functor.obj X .obj W` binders fail
  `Module`-synth. The K1 application threads through by defeq (`pushforward_μ_eq` is `rfl`). For the LHS mate
  side, package as a per-section morphism COMPARISON with `tensor_ext` inside; the parent assembles via
  `PresheafOfModules.hom_ext`. (Used: `pushforward_lax_mu_comparison_{rhs,lhs}_tmul`.)

### Known Blockers (do not retry without a structural change)
- **K1 `pushforward_lax_mu_comparison` — mate route CIRCULAR (re-confirmed iter-028):** the lemma compares
  the adjunction **mate** `Adjunction.rightAdjointLaxMonoidal hadj'` (LHS) against the **composition**
  structure `presheafPushforwardLaxMonoidal φ'` (RHS) on the SAME functor `pushforward φ'`. Unfolding the
  mate (`rightAdjointLaxMonoidal_μ` + `homEquiv_unit`) gives a residual = `Adjunction.IsMonoidal.leftAdjoint_μ`
  = K1's `hmon`, which CONSUMES this lemma → any `IsMonoidal`/`unit_app_tensor_comp_map_δ` route is circular.
  Also it is NOT a 1-to-1 port of `pushforwardComp_lax_μ` (that compares two *composition* structures, so
  mirroring it only reduces the RHS). ONLY route: compute BOTH sides sectionwise to `m ⊗ₜ n` independently
  (reduce RHS at morphism level via `pushforward_μ_eq` BEFORE `hom_ext`; the mate LHS via unit/δ/counit value
  lemmas). Genuine multi-hundred-LOC seam.
  **iter-029 UPDATE — DECOMPOSED; residual narrowed to ONE sub-lemma.** `pushforward_lax_mu_comparison` is now
  PROVEN as an assembly (`hom_ext` to per-section, defer to `lhs_tmul`); the RHS half
  `pushforward_lax_mu_comparison_rhs_tmul` is PROVEN (`= restrictScalars_μ_app_tmul φ'` by defeq). The SOLE
  open μ-side residual is `pushforward_lax_mu_comparison_lhs_tmul` (sorry@L4353) = the LHS mate
  (adjoint-transported) pure-tensor value: unfold `rightAdjointLaxMonoidal_μ` + `homEquiv_unit` to
  `unit ≫ map(δ Gβ ≫ counit⊗counit)`, evaluate at `m ⊗ₜ n`. Downstream `pushforward_mu_appIso_collapse`
  (sorry@L4506) consumes the comparison at morphism level once lhs_tmul lands — do NOT retry its IsMonoidal route.
- ~~**K1 `pullbackTensorMap_isIso_of_isOpenImmersion` carrier diamond**~~: **RESOLVED iter-023** — see the
  "Carrier-diamond RESOLVED via defeq-composite re-ascription" Proof Pattern above (Gβ composite +
  `zeta:=false` + `erw`). The full K1 mate calculus is now PROVEN and compiles; the SOLE residual is
  `hmon : hadj'.IsMonoidal` (L~4226) — GENUINE math (δ/μ-side twin of the proved D2′ η-bridge
  `presheafUnit_comp_map_eta`; open-immersion analogue of `pushforwardComp_lax_μ`), NOT a wall. NORMAL
  ~100–200 LOC sectionwise prove: `refine ⟨?_,?_⟩` the two fields (`leftAdjoint_ε`, `leftAdjoint_μ`), each
  via `PresheafOfModules.hom_ext` + `ModuleCat.MonoidalCategory.tensor_ext`, reusing the in-file D3′
  machinery `pushforward_μ_eq`/`restrictScalars_μ_app`/`forget₂_restrictScalars_μ_hom_tmul`/
  `pushforward_map_restrictScalars_μ_app_tmul` (Gβ is the same `restrictScalars`-composite shape they
  collapse on pure tensors). Do NOT re-open the diamond / `transport` / `letI`-the-bad-carrier — exhausted
  AND unnecessary. (The two iter-022 "substrate exits" are obsolete; the composite-re-ascription beat both.)
  **iter-024 UPDATE — `hmon` mate-transport is a DEAD-END (circular); do NOT repeat it.** iter-024 did NOT
  prove the two `IsMonoidal` fields directly; it transported them across `H1 = leftAdjointUniq` from known
  `adj₀.IsMonoidal` (reusing `presheafUnit_comp_map_eta` for ε), leaving residuals `hηcompat` (L~4244) /
  `hδcompat` (L~4262) = "`H1` is a monoidal natural iso". The prover honestly confirms `hδcompat ⟺ the
  original `hcompat`** — a RE-EXPRESSION, not a reduction. The fundamental obligation is unchanged = the
  sectionwise pure-tensor `f.appIso` collapse. CRUX WRINKLE blocking the direct route too: `Gβ.obj (A⊗B)` is
  a **pushforward of a tensor, NOT a syntactic tensor**, so `tensor_ext` does NOT fire after `hom_ext`
  ("CommRing metavar stuck") — the pure-tensor extensionality must thread through `pushforward₀OfCommRingCat`
  sections (the `pushforwardComp_lax_μ` helper family), exactly as that sibling composite did. Next: close
  `hδcompat`/`hηcompat` sectionwise on pure tensors via those helpers; effort-break `hmon` into ε/μ fields if
  it stalls. NO more mate-transport / carrier reshuffles.
  **iter-025 UPDATE — K1 body now FULLY PROVED; obstacle cleanly reduced to TWO top-level collapse lemmas.**
  The effort-breaker extracted `hmon`'s two obligations to top-level lemmas `pushforward_eta_appIso_collapse`
  (η-side, L~4158, effort 765) and `pushforward_mu_appIso_collapse` (μ/δ-side, L~4239, the multi-hundred-LOC
  load-bearing residual). Their first wiring ERRORED (data-instance opacity — see Proof Pattern); fixed by
  `haveI→letI` (×5) + `have hadj→let hadj`. Now `hmon : hadj'.IsMonoidal` is a REAL proof (L4380) consuming
  the two lemmas, so K1 is transitively sorry ONLY through their bodies. **Prove the μ-collapse DIRECTLY**
  (goal confirmed `δ(pullback φ') A B = e.hom` per A B; mirror `pushforwardComp_lax_μ` ONE-TO-ONE) — routing
  it through `hmon`/`Adjunction.IsMonoidal` is **CIRCULAR** (`hmon` consumes it). η-twin is the smaller
  `𝟙_`-module collapse; thread `pushforward₀OfCommRingCat` sections, NOT `tensor_ext`.
  **iter-026 UPDATE — μ-circularity EMPIRICALLY CONFIRMED; η-side NEARLY CLOSED.** The mate route
  (`Adjunction.unit_app_tensor_comp_map_δ (adj := hadj')` / η-twin `unit_app_unit_comp_map_η hadj'`) FAILS:
  both error "failed to synthesize `hadj'.IsMonoidal`" = the very `hmon` they'd build. **Do NOT attempt the
  mate route for either collapse lemma.** The genuine μ-residual (L4287) = the BARE tensorator comparison
  `μ(rightAdjointLaxMonoidal hadj') = μ(presheafPushforwardLaxMonoidal)` on `Gβ A, Gβ B`, proved DIRECTLY
  sectionwise on `pushforward₀OfCommRingCat` pure tensors (mirror `pushforwardComp_lax_μ` L2197; multi-hundred
  LOC; mathlib-analogist / effort-break first). **η-side (L4182) is one step from done:** transposed across
  `hadj'` (needs `have hadj`→`let hadj` so `erw` key-matches the zeta-unfolded `H1`) + `presheafUnit_comp_map_eta`
  + `epsilonPresheafToSheafUnit` reduce it to the single ring identity `LHS(1)=(φ'.app U)(1)`; the only missing
  piece is a presheaf-level `pushforwardPushforwardAdj.unit` sectionwise value lemma (`rfl`-shaped, orientation
  per `PresheafInternalHom.lean:442`), then `erw` it + `ModuleCat.restrictScalars_η` + `map_one`.
  **iter-027 UPDATE — η STILL NOT CLOSED (13th iter at sorry~3); blocker is now pure Lean PLUMBING, not
  math.** The presheaf-level unit value lemma was added as a `rfl` helper
  `pushforwardPushforwardAdj_unit_app_app_apply` (generic `adj`, ~L4094): `(((unit.app M).app U).hom x =
  (M.map (adj.counit.app U.unop).op).hom x)`. ⚠ At the η use site (L4211) the `simp only
  [pushforwardPushforwardAdj_unit_app_app_apply]` is a **NO-OP** (auditor: unused simp arg; goal identical
  before/after) — the prior `pushforward_map_app_apply` already landed the goal in the form the next
  `erw [unit_map_one]` closes. So the helper is NOT load-bearing here; the genuine residual after the
  reduction chain is the single ring-unit identity
  `((restrictScalars β').map 𝟙 ≫ η (restrictScalars β')).app W).hom 1 = (φ'.app U) 1` (`W := op (f ⁻¹ᵁ U)`),
  both sides `= 1`. TWO independent STATING/COERCION obstacles block it (math is settled — `Functor.Monoidal.ε_η`
  + injective `ε.app W` + `restrictScalars_η`): (a) `map_one` won't fire on `ConcreteCategory.hom (φ'.app U)`
  (RingCat-coercion `DFunLike.coe (fun X Y ↦ RingHom.instFunLike)`) — need a RingCat-flavoured `map_one` or
  expose the bare `RingHom`; (b) cannot even STATE `1 : (𝟙_ _).obj W` (`OfNat` synth won't reduce `𝟙_ =
  unit _`) — a drafted `restrictScalars_oplaxMonoidal_η_app_one` could not be written for this reason; FIX =
  phrase the unit element via `PresheafOfModules.unit` (carrier `R.obj W`, a real ring), transport along
  `𝟙_ = unit` defeq. **NEXT: effort-break η into these two sub-lemmas (do NOT re-run a plain prove lane —
  3 iters no close). Also DELETE the dead simp step + fix the inaccurate crediting comments L4208–4214.**
  μ-side untouched iter-027 (`pushforward_lax_mu_comparison` still a bare ORPHANED sorry — not wired to its
  consumer `pushforward_mu_appIso_collapse`; mirror `pushforwardComp_lax_μ`, multi-hundred LOC; NEVER via `hmon`).
- ~~**`DualInverse.lean` is RED**~~: RESOLVED iter-007 (repaired to GREEN + split into
  `DualInverse/SliceTransport.lean`; forward naturality then closed). The DUAL chain is now an
  ordinary proving task, not a regression. Dead approaches that remain DEAD: `ext z`+`exact hφ z`
  (applies an equality as a function); pointwise `ext z; simp [dualUnitRingSwap_apply]` / any
  `inv ε` through `whnf` (the ≥6-iter deterministic-timeout, reproduced again iter-007). Use the
  pointwise `_apply` rotation pattern above instead.
- ~~`pullbackTensorMap_restrict` (D3′ outer)~~: **BODY CLOSED iter-018** (steps i@015, ii@016,
  iii-a/b.1/b.2@017, hcore2@018; recipe in the `hcore2` Proof-Pattern entry above). Sorry-free in its own
  body; delegates its sole residual by `exact` to the leaf brick `pullbackValIso_comp_leg`. ⚠ Do NOT
  re-assign the standalone extraction `pullbackTensorMap_restrict_core` — it does NOT elaborate at top level
  (carrier-instance trap above); content is realized in-place, its blueprint `\lean{}` pin was dropped.
- ~~`pullbackValIso_comp_leg` (blueprint `lem:pullback_val_iso_comp`, Sq4)~~: **CLOSED iter-019,
  axiom-clean** (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`; no `sorryAx`). The 5-iter wall broke via the
  **unit-naturality fold** (Proof Pattern below): `η^Z` naturality on both legs factors out a common
  `η ≫ forget(·)` → clean carrier-level cocycle `hH` → `slice` folds + `exact comp_forget_cocycle …`;
  `hH` via Sq4a inverse (`inv_telescope`) + `pullbackComp` naturality at counit + (T) triangle
  `(adj.homEquiv …).left_inv`. The ENTIRE D3′ comparison-iso cone is now sorry-free. Do NOT re-open.
- ~~`sliceDualTransport` left_inv / right_inv~~: **BOTH CLOSED (left_inv iter-014, right_inv iter-015).**
  `sliceDualTransport` is now sorry-free + axiom-clean; the **DUAL route is CLOSED** (verified green, full
  chain 8322 jobs). right_inv = 3-step mirror of left_inv (ring-identity collapse via
  `appIso_inv_naturality` → ψ-naturality `hψ` → `Y.presheaf` round-trip `hmaps`); the real blocker turned
  out to be a heartbeat overflow, not a math wall (see Proof Patterns). Retire the DUAL lane.
- **`exists_tensorObj_inverse` — MOVED to `TensorObjInverse.lean` iter-023 (import-cycle resolved); descent
  skeleton built, TWO residuals.** The refactor-MOVE (downstream of DualInverse; RelPicFunctor repointed,
  build GREEN) un-gated the proof; the bare sorry is now the full `rem:dual_discharges_inverse` descent
  (object `dual L` + C-bridge `dual_isLocallyTrivial` CLOSED; local data `eM`/`eN`/`e`/`uι`/`f` + glued `ε`
  via `homOfLocalCompat` + B-bridge `isIso_of_isIso_restrict` + `asIso` all built and compile). Residuals:
  (A) cocycle `hf` (L~121) — the `g·g⁻¹=1` transition-unit cancellation through `tensorObj_restrict_iso`/
  `tensorObjIsoOfIso`/`dualIsoOfIso`; GENUINE ab-group section maps, `subsingleton` is the WRONG tool
  (verified); large, self-contained, d.2-free. Cleaner abstract route (iter-024): `dualIsoOfIso`
  contravariant functoriality + `tensorObjIsoOfIso` bifunctoriality + unit self-duality cancellation
  (`a ⊗ dual(a)⁻¹ ≫ tensorObj_unit_iso = tensorObj_unit_iso`) — candidate for effort-break. (B)
  restriction-connector — iter-024 REDUCED to the exact equation `key` (L~139): `rw [key]; exact hfiso x`
  compiles, so B is **one line from done**. `key`'s body = the missing lemma in `DualInverse.lean`:
  `homOfLocalCompat_restrictFunctor_map : (restrictFunctor (U i).ι).map (homOfLocalCompat U hU f hf) = f i`
  (~40–80 LOC reusing the def's internal `hconn`/`IsGluing`; frontier node `lem:hom_of_local_compat_restrict`).
  **It was scheduled iter-024 but the lane produced NO edit — still does not exist; re-dispatch it standalone
  on `DualInverse.lean` (cheapest remaining win).** Type trap: `(SheafOfModules.unit …).restrict` dot-notation
  resolves to the `SheafOfModules` head → use function form `restrict (unit …) (U x).ι`.
  **iter-025 UPDATE — connector STILL undelivered (3rd consecutive iter: 023/024/025); DualInverse.lean was
  never edited again.** This is now an EXECUTION-DISPATCH failure, not a math wall — force a dedicated,
  non-co-assigned prover onto DualInverse.lean and confirm it runs. Progress made on residual A instead: the
  6 abstract-route ingredients (1)(2) now EXIST as axiom-clean helpers in `TensorObjInverse.lean`
  (`tensorObjIsoOfIso_{trans,refl}`, `presheaf_dualIsoOfIso_{trans,refl}`, `dualIsoOfIso_{trans,refl}` — contra-
  variant `dualIsoOfIso` functoriality + bifunctorial `tensorObjIsoOfIso`). Residual A's remaining hard core =
  ingredient (3), the eval-pairing self-duality cancellation at the `dualPrecompEquiv`/`internalHomEval`
  SECTION level (global eval map deliberately never built), + an iso→section bridge. Reusable: functoriality
  rewrites on `(SheafOfModules.forget _).mapIso e` (carrier `presheaf⋙forget₂`) need `erw`+trailing `rfl`.
  **iter-026 UPDATE — connector RESOLVED + residual B CLOSED.** Root cause of the 3-iter connector
  non-delivery: plan-validate DROPPED the DualInverse objective every iter because the file had 0 sorries
  (prover never dispatched, not "delivered nothing"). FIX: scaffold the stub in the SAME plan phase so the
  lane dispatches. The prover then CLOSED `homOfLocalCompat_restrictFunctor_map` (axiom-clean) — reconstruct
  the gluing internals defeq + `change` to `g`-form + a morphism-level `key` lemma collapsing the
  eqToHom-conjugation via `eqToHom_comp_iff` + `exact`-matched `naturality` (`rw` of naturality fails on
  X-vs-restrict defeq; `(U i).ι ''ᵁ P ≤ U i` is `Scheme.Opens.ι_image_le`, NOT `image_le_range` which doesn't
  exist). Residual B then closed one-line: `exact homOfLocalCompat_restrictFunctor_map U _ f _ x`. **Residual
  A (cocycle) is now the SOLE terminal residual — and it is BLUEPRINT-GATED, not prover-ready:** ingredient
  (3) decomposes into two helper lemmas that exist ONLY as prose in `rem:dual_discharges_inverse` (lvb-inverse026
  major) — (A) further-restriction compatibility of `tensorObj_restrict_iso`/`restrictFunctorIsoPullback`/
  `pullbackUnitIso`, (B) the unit self-duality eval collapse `tensorObjIsoOfIso t (dualIsoOfIso t)⁻¹ ≫
  tensorObj_unit_iso = tensorObj_unit_iso`. Author their `\lean{}` blocks (blueprint-writer) BEFORE any prover
  lane; a plain prover re-hits the section-vs-iso-level wall (verified: `rfl`/`simp[_trans/_refl]`/`congr 1`/
  `hom_ext` all fail on the post-`simp` cocycle goal — distinct opaque trivialisations `eM i.some`/`eM j.some`).
- **`pullbackTensorMap_isIso_of_isOpenImmersion` (K1, L4172) — open-immersion δ-iso (iter-020):** the
  sole open D4′ brick. Do NOT retry the in-file `Functor.Monoidal.transport` route: it fails on two
  Mathlib-absent instance diamonds — (1) `MonoidalCategory (PresheafOfModules X.ringCatSheaf.obj)` not
  globally synthesizable (carrier keyed on syntactic `X.presheaf ⋙ forget₂`, only defeq — the standing
  monoidal-carrier wall, now at FUNCTOR level), (2) goal `δ` = `presheafPullbackOplaxMonoidal` (adjunction
  mate) vs `transport.toOplaxMonoidal.δ` (via `coreMonoidalTransport`) not defeq → no `transport_δ` bridge.
  The math is settled (object-level fact CLOSED in `tensorObj_restrict_iso`); missing piece = a
  functor-level strong-monoidal pullback model = Mathlib-scale. Route to mathlib-analogist/mathlib-build;
  ingredient in `informal/pullbackTensorMap_isIso_of_isOpenImmersion.md`.
- ~~`sheafificationCompPullback_comp_tail`~~ / ~~`_comp`~~: CLOSED iter-006 (NatTrans-cocycle pattern above).
- `sliceDualTransport.naturality`: CONFIRMED iter-007 — do NOT inline the elementwise proof in the
  monolithic `LinearEquiv` (it closes in isolation but pushes later fields past heartbeat limits).
  Factor into a standalone helper (`sliceDualTransport_naturality_apply`) and call it from the field.
  The forward direction is now CLOSED this way; the inv-naturality root (L444) awaits the same mirror.
- `sheafificationCompPullback_comp`: do not retry raw `aesop_cat`, reassociation, `← Functor.map_comp`,
  or sectionwise `hom_ext`. The remaining blocker is the mixed comparison
  (`sheafificationCompPullback h` followed by sheafified `PresheafOfModules.pullbackComp.hom`) and
  functor-associator cleanup.

### Extraction mechanics (non-obvious gotchas)
- **Confirmed truncation bug:** the extraction's Lean-decl remover truncated DualInverse.lean's
  entire §C tail mid-`/-- … -/` docstring, committing a non-compiling file (`unterminated comment`)
  that broke the whole downstream cone. The parent repo
  `/home/archon/FormalizationProjects/Algebraic-Jacobian-Challenge/` is the last-known-good source
  of truth: diff the byte-identical prefix and restore the lost tail. **Other extracted files may be
  similarly truncated — worth a one-shot sweep.**

re-ascription (Gβ + `zeta:=false` + `erw`); new Proof Pattern added, K1 Known-Blocker marked RESOLVED, sole
residual now the sectionwise `hmon : hadj'.IsMonoidal`. Terminal `exists_tensorObj_inverse` MOVED to
`TensorObjInverse.lean` + descent skeleton built (2 residuals: cocycle + a needed `DualInverse.lean`
connector). Sorry 2→3, both files GREEN, 0 axioms. Reviewers aud023/substrate023/inverse023 all 0 must-fix.
Carrier-diamond `% NOTE` refreshed to iter-023. Session narrative in `iter/iter-023/review.md`.)
2026-06-18T11:45:00Z (iter-022 review — recon022 K1 mate route EXHAUSTED; `hcompat` reduced to ★ but blocked
by the carrier diamond at instance synthesis. Known Blockers K1 entry rewritten with the two substrate exits;
session narrative in `iter/iter-022/review.md`.)
2026-06-18T10:25:00Z (iter-021 review — K1 scaffolded; session narrative in `iter/iter-021/review.md`,
Knowledge Base updated above with the presheaf-δ mate-witness pattern + the `hcompat` blocker.)

2026-06-18T09:15:00Z (iter-020 review — **D4′ CHART-CHASE BUILT**: seed-1 `pullbackTensorIsoOfLocallyTrivial`
has a sorry-free chart-chase body (5 new decls; `isIso_of_isIso_comp4_mid` + K2 axiom-clean). Sole open D4′
residual = K1 `pullbackTensorMap_isIso_of_isOpenImmersion` (L4172) — `Functor.Monoidal.transport` route hit
the functor-level monoidal-carrier wall (pre-authorized reversal signal) → mathlib-analogist/mathlib-build,
NOT a retry. File sorry 2→2 (K1 + deferred terminal). aud020 0 must-fix/2 major (stale .lean comments→next
prover). tos020 1 must-fix = blueprint omits the K1 node + wrong "only D3′ is new" claim→blueprint-writer.
Stale `% NOTE:` on loctriv block rewritten (pin now resolves). gaps=0, unmatched=108, sync +2 (711be2f),
doctor clean. Next: unblock K1 + add its blueprint node; terminal `exists_tensorObj_inverse` MOVE.)

(iter-019 — **D3′ CONE CLOSED**: `pullbackValIso_comp_leg` (the 5-iter-stuck
Sq4 leaf) CLOSED + axiom-clean via the unit-naturality fold + generic-`exact` device (5 new non-vacuous
`private` helpers: `comp_forget_cocycle`, `inv_telescope`, `cocycle_assemble`,
`sheafificationCompPullback_comp_inv`, `adj_unit_map_counit`). sorry 2→1 (sole remaining =
`exists_tensorObj_inverse`, import-cycle deferred). File GREEN 8321 jobs. aud019 PASS (both leaf +
`pullbackTensorMap_restrict` axiom-clean, helpers used; 3 stale `.lean` comments → next prover). tos019
PASS (signature + proof match blueprint; scpb pinned to `sheafificationCompPullback_comp_inv`; counit
NOTE corrected). `archon dag-query gaps`=0 ∞-holes. sync +2 `\leanok` (023f2ca). dag unmatched 105.
Next iter = PIVOT to downstream consumers `pullbackTensorIsoOfLocallyTrivial` → `pullback_tensorObj_iso`
→ chain to `exists_tensorObj_inverse` (consuming file).
clean convergence test on the brick; effort-breaker if it stalls. exists_tensorObj_inverse untouched.)
