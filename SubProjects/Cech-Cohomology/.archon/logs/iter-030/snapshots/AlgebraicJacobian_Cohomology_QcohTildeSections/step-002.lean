# Quasi-coherent sheaves on an affine are sections-tilde (Stacks 01HV/01I8)

Project-local: the affine quasi-coherent structure theorem.  For an `𝒪_X`-module `F`
on an affine `X = Spec R`, with `M = Γ(X, F)`, there is a natural isomorphism
`F ≅ M^~`, under which `Γ(D(f), F) = M_f`.

## The Mathlib gradient

Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.Modules.Tilde` development provides:

* `Scheme.Modules.fromTildeΓ F : tilde (Γ F) ⟶ F` — the counit of the
  tilde ⊣ global-sections adjunction;
* `isIso_fromTildeΓ_iff : IsIso F.fromTildeΓ ↔ (tilde.functor R).essImage F`;
* `isIso_fromTildeΓ_of_presentation F (P : F.Presentation) : IsIso F.fromTildeΓ` —
  the counit is an isomorphism whenever `F` admits a **global** presentation
  (a global generating family together with a global generating family of relations).

The genuine remaining gap — **Stacks Tag 01I8**, the affine equivalence
`QCoh(Spec R) ≃ Mod R` — is the implication

  `[IsQuasicoherent F]  ⟹  IsIso F.fromTildeΓ`   (on the affine `Spec R`).

`IsQuasicoherent F` only supplies *local* presentation data on a cover
(`QuasicoherentData`); turning that into a *global* presentation on the affine base
(or directly into membership of the essential image of `tilde`) is the content of the
affine equivalence and is not yet in Mathlib.  See the `## Handoff` section at the
bottom of this file for the precise decomposition.

This file therefore delivers the structure theorem **conditioned on the counit being
an isomorphism** (`qcoh_iso_tilde_sections`), and a ready-to-use **presentation form**
(`qcoh_iso_tilde_sections_of_presentation`) that discharges that condition via the
Mathlib presentation lemma.  Once the 01I8 instance
`[IsQuasicoherent F] → IsIso F.fromTildeΓ` lands, the conditional form upgrades to the
unconditional quasi-coherent statement with no further work.

`tilde (Γ F) ⟶ F` of an `𝒪_{Spec R}`-module `F` is an isomorphism — which holds for every

sole remaining gap; see `qcoh_iso_tilde_sections_of_presentation` for the presentation-based
discharge) — then `F` is isomorphic to the sheaf associated with its module of global
sections `M = Γ(Spec R, F)`.  Project-local because Mathlib exposes only the counit and the

/-! ### Reduction to global generation (Stacks 01I8, steps 2–3)

The unconditional quasi-coherent instance `[IsQuasicoherent F] → IsIso F.fromTildeΓ` is, by the
three-step 01I8 decomposition (`rem:o1i8_decomposition`), reduced to producing two *global*
generating families: one for `F` itself and one for the kernel of the resulting epimorphism.  The
declarations below formalise steps (2)–(3) — assembling those two families into a global
presentation and feeding it to Mathlib's `isIso_fromTildeΓ_of_presentation` — turning what were
prose steps in the Handoff into axiom-clean Lean.  The single remaining mathematical input is the
affine global-generation theorem (step (1)), which supplies the two `GeneratingSections`.
-/

/-- A finite-free / free `𝒪_{Spec R}`-module is quasi-coherent: it is the tilde of `ι →₀ R`
(`tildeFinsupp`), and quasi-coherence is closed under isomorphism.  Project-local supplement; used
to recognise the kernel-side coefficient sheaf of the 01I8 presentation route as quasi-coherent. -/
instance free_isQuasicoherent (ι : Type u) :
    (SheafOfModules.free.{u} (R := (Spec R).ringCatSheaf) ι).IsQuasicoherent :=
  (SheafOfModules.isQuasicoherent.{u} (Spec R).ringCatSheaf).prop_of_iso
    (tildeFinsupp (R := R) ι) inferInstance

/-- **01I8 steps (2)–(3), packaged.**  If an `𝒪_{Spec R}`-module `F` is globally generated
(`σ : F.GeneratingSections`, a global epimorphism `free σ.I ⟶ F`) and the kernel of that
epimorphism is itself globally generated (`τ : (kernel σ.π).GeneratingSections`), then the
tilde–Γ counit `tilde (Γ F) ⟶ F` is an isomorphism.  This bundles the two generating families
into a global `F.Presentation` and feeds it to Mathlib's `isIso_fromTildeΓ_of_presentation`; it is
the formal content of steps (2)–(3) of the 01I8 decomposition.  The single remaining mathematical
input is the affine global-generation theorem (step (1)) producing `σ` and `τ` for a quasi-coherent
`F`.  Project-local because it repackages the Mathlib presentation criterion in the
two-generating-families form the 01I8 route consumes. -/

/-! ## Handoff — closing the 01I8 gap

The unconditional quasi-coherent statement

```
theorem qcoh_iso_tilde_sections_qcoh (F : (Spec R).Modules) [IsQuasicoherent F] :
    F ≅ tilde (moduleSpecΓFunctor.obj F)
```

is obtained from `qcoh_iso_tilde_sections` the instant the following instance is available:

```
instance (F : (Spec R).Modules) [IsQuasicoherent F] : IsIso F.fromTildeΓ
```

equivalently (by `isIso_fromTildeΓ_iff`) `(tilde.functor R).essImage F`, equivalently a
**global** `F.Presentation` (fed to `qcoh_iso_tilde_sections_of_presentation`).

The needed Mathlib-gradient sub-steps (all on the affine base `Spec R`):

1. `IsQuasicoherent F` ⟹ `F` is generated by global sections: produce
   `F.GeneratingSections` (a global epi `free I ⟶ F`).  On `Spec R` this is the affine
   global-generation statement (Hartshorne II.5.16 / Stacks 01I8); `QuasicoherentData`
   only gives generation locally on a basic-open cover, which must be globalised using
   `PrimeSpectrum.exists_idempotent_basicOpen_eq_of_isClopen`-style partition-of-unity /
   the compactness of `Spec R` and the localisation-of-sections property of qcoh sheaves.
   **This is the single genuine remaining blocker** (sections of qcoh `F` over `D(f)`
   localise — `Γ(D(f), F) = Γ(X, F)_f`, Stacks 01HV(4)/01I8 — is itself absent from Mathlib:
   `grep` confirms the only `IsQuasicoherent` content in `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/` is
   `Modules/Tilde.lean`, with no localisation-of-sections and no abelian-subcategory closure).
2. The kernel of `free I ⟶ F` is again quasi-coherent on `Spec R` (NB: not yet a Mathlib
   instance — `kernel σ.π` is not automatically qcoh; this needs the qcoh-is-abelian-subcategory
   fact, itself downstream of step 1's local structure), hence again globally generated by
   step 1; this yields the two `GeneratingSections` `σ`, `τ` of `F.Presentation`.
3. Feed those two generating families to `isIso_fromTildeΓ_of_genSections` (below), which
   bundles them into `F.Presentation` and applies Mathlib's `isIso_fromTildeΓ_of_presentation`,
   producing the `IsIso F.fromTildeΓ` instance above.

**Steps 2–3 are now formalised** as the axiom-clean `isIso_fromTildeΓ_of_genSections` and
`qcoh_iso_tilde_sections_of_genSections` (the structure theorem directly from the two generating
families), with `free_isQuasicoherent` recording that free coefficient sheaves are qcoh.  Step 1 —
the load-bearing ~few-hundred-LOC affine global-generation / localisation-of-sections input — is
the single genuine mathematical blocker; once it supplies `σ : F.GeneratingSections` and
`τ : (kernel σ.π).GeneratingSections` for a quasi-coherent `F`, the instance and the unconditional
upgrade of `qcoh_iso_tilde_sections` follow with no further work.
