# Blueprint Doctor

## Malformed annotations

Annotations with an empty argument (`\uses{}`, `\proves{}`, `\label{}`, `\ref{}`, ...) or an empty list item (`\uses{a,,b}`, `\uses{a,}`). plastex emits `Label '' could not be resolved` for each of these and then the leanblueprint depgraph builder enters infinite recursion (`RecursionError`), so the blueprint never finishes building. Fix each one by either filling in the intended label or deleting the empty annotation. Do NOT defer — the next `leanblueprint web` run will crash until these are resolved.

### `blueprint/src/chapters/Albanese_CodimOneExtension.tex`
- `\uses{...}` — empty argument
