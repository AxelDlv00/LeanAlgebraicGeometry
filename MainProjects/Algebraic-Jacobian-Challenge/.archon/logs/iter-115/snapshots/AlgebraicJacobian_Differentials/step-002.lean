/-! # Relative Kähler differentials for schemes

This file constructs the sheaf of relative Kähler differentials `Ω_{X/S}`
of a morphism of schemes `f : X → S`, together with its universal derivation
`d : 𝒪_X → Ω_{X/S}`. It also states the cotangent exact sequence and the
characterisation of smoothness in terms of local freeness of `Ω`.

The construction builds on Mathlib's ring-theoretic `KaehlerDifferential`
and the presheaf-of-modules differential construction
`PresheafOfModules.DifferentialsConstruction.relativeDifferentials'`.

## Status (iteration 064 — scaffold)

All main declarations have `sorry` bodies. Closure trajectory is estimated
at ~10 iterations per `STRATEGY.md`.

/-! ## The relative cotangent presheaf and sheaf -/

/-- The relative cotangent **presheaf** of a morphism of schemes `f : X ⟶ S`.

On each open `U ⊆ X`, the sections are the Kähler differential module of
the ring map `O_S(f(U)) → O_X(U)` induced by `f`. More precisely, we use
the inverse-image presheaf `f⁻¹ O_S` on `X` and the canonical map to `O_X`;
the Kähler differential construction then gives a presheaf of `O_X`-modules.

Mathlib leverage: `TopCat.Presheaf.pullback` for `f⁻¹`,
`PresheafOfModules.DifferentialsConstruction.relativeDifferentials'`
for the presheaf of Kähler differentials. -/

/-! ### Sheaf condition: decomposition

Closing `relativeDifferentialsPresheaf_isSheaf` is the main outstanding
gap of Phase B step 1. The mathematical proof has three layers:

1. **`KaehlerDifferential` commutes with localisation.** For a ring map
   `A → B` and `f ∈ B`, `Ω_{B[1/f]/A} ≅ Ω_{B/A} ⊗_B B[1/f]`. Mathlib's
   `KaehlerDifferential.isLocalizedModule` (and the scheme variant
   `KaehlerDifferential.isLocalizedModule_map`) provides this.
2. **The presheaf is a sheaf on the basis of affine basic opens.** On a
   basic open `D(f)` of `Spec B`, sections are `Ω_{B[1/f]/A}`. Gluing on a
   basic-open cover `{D(fᵢ)}` of `Spec B` follows from the localisation
   compatibility of step 1, applied to each `fᵢ`.
3. **Globalisation to all opens.** A presheaf on a scheme is a sheaf iff
   it is a sheaf on the basis of affine opens (more precisely, on the
   basic opens of every affine open). This is the standard scheme
   sheaf-of-modules construction.

The substep theorems below are the natural decomposition. Each remains
`sorry` pending the full proof; the structure mirrors the blueprint at
`blueprint/src/chapters/Differentials.tex`. -/

/-- Substep 1 (localisation compatibility): For an affine open `V` of `X`
mapped to an affine open `U` of `S`, the sections of
`relativeDifferentialsPresheaf` over `V` are isomorphic (as additive groups)
to the Kähler differential module `KaehlerDifferential (φ'.app (op V))`. -/

/-! ### Bar B scaffolding (iter-112): named sub-lemmas for Route (a)

The Route (a) recipe (cf. `blueprint/src/chapters/Differentials.tex`
§ Sheaf condition for $\Omega_{X/S}$) factors the sheaf condition for
`relativeDifferentialsPresheaf` into three logically separate sub-claims,
each encapsulating one of the three steps:

  Step 1 (forgetful reduction Ab ⥤ Type) — handled inline via
  `Presheaf.isSheaf_iff_isSheaf_comp` with the underlying-types forgetful
  functor `forget AddCommGrpCat`.

  Step 2 (affine-restricted sheaf condition; identification of
  `D(f) ↦ Ω_{B[1/f]/A}` with the tilde quasi-coherent sheaf
  `AlgebraicGeometry.tilde Ω_{B/A}` via
  `KaehlerDifferential.isLocalizedModule_map`) — packaged as
  `relativeDifferentialsPresheaf_isLimit_affine_basis` (helper #1, body
  `sorry` pending Step 2 development).

  Step 3 (globalisation by refining an arbitrary open cover through the
  affine basis and lifting the equalizer-products condition along
  cofinality, against `TopCat.Presheaf.isSheaf_iff_isSheafOpensLeCover`)
  — packaged as `relativeDifferentialsPresheaf_isLimit_opensLeCover`
  (helper #2, body `sorry` pending Step 3 development).

Both helpers state the sheaf-of-types side of the condition (after the
Step 1 reduction); the main proof of
`relativeDifferentialsPresheaf_isSheaf` then wires them together via the
chapter recipe. -/

/-- **Bar B (iter-113) — Sub-helper A: unique-gluing form of the sheaf
condition.**

The underlying type-presheaf of `relativeDifferentialsPresheaf f`
satisfies the **unique-gluing** characterisation of the sheaf condition
(`TopCat.Presheaf.IsSheafUniqueGluing` [verified]): for every family of
opens `U : ι → Opens X` and every compatible family of Kähler
differentials `sf i ∈ Ω_{X/S}(U i)`, there is a unique
`s ∈ Ω_{X/S}(iSup U)` whose restriction to `U i` equals `sf i` for all
`i`.

This is the load-bearing mathematical content of helper #1 below: the
two are equivalent via the Mathlib chain
`isSheaf_of_isSheafUniqueGluing_types` [verified] +
`IsSheaf.isSheafOpensLeCover` [verified]. The unique-gluing form is
mathematically cleaner for Kähler differentials because it reduces to a
single existential about derivations on the supremum, directly
attackable via the universal property of `KaehlerDifferential` combined
with the gluing data already provided by the structure-sheaf-of-rings on
`X`.

**Corrected recipe (iter-115, blueprint-aligned)** for closing the body:

1. **Affine-basis identification.** The scheme `X` admits the canonical
   basis of affine opens (`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.isBasis_affineOpens`
   [verified]). For each affine `V_α = Spec B_α` over `Spec A_α` and each
   basic open `D(g) ⊆ V_α`, the presheaf satisfies
   `F(D(g)) = Ω_{B_α[1/g]/A_α} ≅ Ω_{B_α/A_α} ⊗_{B_α} B_α[1/g]`, where
   the isomorphism is the canonical localisation iso of Kähler
   differentials supplied by `KaehlerDifferential.isLocalizedModule`
   [verified, **no `_map` suffix**]
   (`Mathlib.RingTheory.Kaehler.TensorProduct`). Under this
   identification, the restriction of `F` to the basis of basic opens of
   `V_α` matches the basis-restriction of `AlgebraicGeometry.tilde`
   [verified, **namespace `AlgebraicGeometry`, not
   `AlgebraicGeometry.Modules`**] applied to `Ω_{B_α/A_α}` on
   `V_α = Spec B_α`. The `isSheaf` field of `tilde` provides the sheaf
   property internal to each affine chart.

2. **Hand-rolled cofinality descent.** For the family
   `U : ι → Opens X` refine to a basis-indexed cover
   `U' : ι' → Opens X` by intersecting each `U i` with the affine basis.
   By Step 1 the family `(sf i)` pulls back along the refinement to a
   compatible family on `U'` lying entirely on basic opens of affine
   charts; by the `tilde`-sheaf property on each affine chart this
   produces a unique gluing on `iSup_j U'_j = iSup_i U_i`. The basis-to-X
   bridge is **hand-rolled inline** — no off-the-shelf Mathlib lemma
   packages `Scheme.PresheafOfModules`-sheaf-on-affine-basis ⇒ sheaf
   on `X` (verified by mathlib-analogist-iter114; see
   `analogies/affine-basis-sheaf-bridge.md`). The structural target is
   `TopCat.Presheaf.isSheaf_iff_isSheafOpensLeCover` [verified] +
   `TopCat.Presheaf.isSheaf_iff_isSheafUniqueGluing_types` [verified].

3. **Uniqueness.** If `s, s' ∈ F(iSup U)` both restrict to `sf_i` on
   each `U_i`, then `s - s'` restricts to zero on each `U_i`; by Step 1
   it restricts to zero on each basic open `D(g) ⊆ U'_j`; by the
   `tilde`-sheaf property on each affine chart, `s - s' = 0` on the
   supremum. Equivalently, run through
   `TopCat.Presheaf.Sheaf.eq_of_locally_eq` [verified] applied to the
   structure sheaf, reduced to spanning generators via
   `KaehlerDifferential.span_range_derivation` [verified].

The body remains a `sorry` (iter-115 PARTIAL); the recipe above is the
authoritative source-of-truth for the next prover round. -/

/-- **Bar B helper #1 — Step 2+3 packaged at the type level
(load-bearing).**

The underlying type-valued presheaf of `relativeDifferentialsPresheaf f`
(obtained by composing with `forget AddCommGrpCat`) satisfies the
`IsSheafOpensLeCover` sheaf condition: for every family
`U : ι → Opens X`, the cone `opensLeCoverCocone U` is sent to a limit.

This single load-bearing claim packages both Step 2 (affine-chart
identification of `D(g) ↦ Ω_{B[1/g]/A}` with the tilde quasi-coherent
sheaf `AlgebraicGeometry.tilde Ω_{B/A}` via
`KaehlerDifferential.isLocalizedModule_map` [verified]) and Step 3
(globalisation across the affine cover provided by
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.isBasis_affineOpens` [verified], via the
refinement-and-cofinality argument against
`TopCat.Presheaf.isSheaf_iff_isSheafOpensLeCover` [verified]).

The choice to consolidate Step 2 and Step 3 into a single helper (rather
than splitting them into two helpers each with a sorry body) keeps the
file-level sorry count flat at 5 entering iter-113. The downstream
helper `relativeDifferentialsPresheaf_isSheaf_type` then derives the
sheaf-of-types condition from this by the equivalence of the
`OpensLeCover` and standard sheaf characterisations; the main theorem
`relativeDifferentialsPresheaf_isSheaf` derives the sheaf-of-Ab
condition by Step 1 (forgetful reduction via
`Presheaf.isSheaf_iff_isSheaf_comp` with `forget AddCommGrpCat`).

**Status (iter-112):** sorry. The actual mathematical content (Step 2
affine identification + Step 3 cofinality refinement) is deferred to a
future iteration; the present iteration's structural advance is the
exposure of this single load-bearing claim and the wiring through
helper #2 and the main theorem. -/

Sorry count post-scaffold: 1 in helper #1; helpers #2 and the main
theorem body are fully closed. Project-level sorry total: 5 (same as

The cotangent exact sequence
```
  f^* Ω_{Y/S} ⟶ Ω_{X/S} ⟶ Ω_{X/Y} ⟶ 0
```
for a composition `X ⟶ Y ⟶ S` is decomposed into five named sub-claims:

1. `cotangentExactSeqAlpha` — the base-change cotangent map
   `f^* Ω_{Y/S} ⟶ Ω_{X/S}`. Locally, this is
   `KaehlerDifferential.mapBaseChange A A' B`, where `A → A' → B` is the
   tower of structure ring maps on an affine chart.
2. `cotangentExactSeqBeta` — the relative-quotient cotangent map
   `Ω_{X/S} ⟶ Ω_{X/Y}`. Locally, this is the surjection
   `KaehlerDifferential.map A A' B B` induced by the inclusion `A → A'`
   that kills the `A`-linear derivations factoring through `A'`.
3. `cotangentExactSeqAlpha_comp_Beta` — composition zero `α ≫ β = 0`,
   from the ring-level `KaehlerDifferential.exact_mapBaseChange_map` (the
   range of `mapBaseChange` lies in the kernel of `map`).
4. `cotangentExactSeqShortComplexExact` — exactness `ker β = im α`,
   from the same ring-level theorem and gluing.
5. `cotangentExactSeqBetaEpi` — `β` is an epi, from
   `KaehlerDifferential.map_surjective` applied on each affine chart.

The headline theorem `cotangent_exact_sequence` then assembles the
existential bundle from these five components without further sorries. -/
