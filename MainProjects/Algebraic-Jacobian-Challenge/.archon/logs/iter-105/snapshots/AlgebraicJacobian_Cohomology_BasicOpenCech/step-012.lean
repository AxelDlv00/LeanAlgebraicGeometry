# Basic-open cover wrappers and the substantive Čech acyclicity theorem

This file (iter-063 split, cohort 3) contains the `basicOpenCover` family
of definitions and identification lemmas (iter-054), the producer
`hasAffineCechAcyclicCover_of_basicOpen` (iter-055), the
`cechCohomology_subsingleton_of_cechCochain_exactAt` lemma, and the
substantive theorem `basicOpenCover_isCechAcyclicCover_toModuleKSheaf`
(iter-056 → iter-062). The latter currently carries two labelled substep
sorries plus the iter-062 `h_a_fun` scaffolding.

This is cohort 3 of the original `MayerVietoris.lean` split:
* `MayerVietorisCore.lean`: MV LES core + Mathlib gap-fill.
* `MayerVietorisCover.lean`: 2-affine cover MV + cover-totality bridges +
  `IsCechAcyclicCover` consumers + `HasAffineCechAcyclicCover` carrier.
* `BasicOpenCech.lean` (this file): basic-open cover wrappers + the
  substantive Čech acyclicity theorem.

/-- Iter-054: basic-open cover from a spanning subset of `Γ(C.left, U)`.

Given a subset `s ⊆ Γ(C.left, U)`, this constructs the family of basic opens
`s → Opens` mapping each `f ∈ s` to `C.left.basicOpen f`. When `s` spans the
unit ideal of `Γ(C.left, U)` and `U` is affine, this family covers `U`
(see `basicOpenCover_supr_of_span_eq_top`); each member is itself an affine
open (see `basicOpenCover_isAffineOpen`).

Iter-054 is a thin Mathlib-API wrapper (parameterised by the project's
`C : Over (Spec (.of k))` convention) so iter-055+ instantiation work for
`HasAffineCechAcyclicCover (toModuleKSheaf C)` can call the constructor +
supremum + affine-membership directly.

Mirrors the iter-047 foundational parameterised Čech infrastructure pattern:
package thin Mathlib wrappers as named project-local declarations so the
substantive multi-iteration work downstream focuses purely on content
(Koszul acyclicity + Čech-vs-derived comparison) rather than re-deriving
infrastructure at every call site. -/

/-- Iter-054: supremum equality for the basic-open cover from generators
spanning the unit ideal of an affine open.

Given `(hU : IsAffineOpen U)` and `(hs : Ideal.span s = ⊤)`, the basic-open
cover `basicOpenCover s` covers `U` exactly: `⨆ i, basicOpenCover s i = U`.
This is a thin wrapper around Mathlib's `IsAffineOpen.iSup_basicOpen_eq_self_iff`
(`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/AffineScheme.lean` L898).

Used by iter-055+ when constructing the `HasAffineCechAcyclicCover (toModuleKSheaf C)`
instance: the existential's third conjunct `(⨆ i, 𝒰 i = U)` is exactly what
this theorem produces. -/

affine.

Given `(hU : IsAffineOpen U)` and `(i : s)`, conclude `IsAffineOpen (basicOpenCover s i)`.
This is a thin wrapper around Mathlib's `IsAffineOpen.basicOpen`
(`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/AffineScheme.lean` L589).

Used by iter-055+ when proving the Koszul acyclicity of the basic-open Čech
complex: each finite intersection of basic opens is itself basic (hence affine),
which is the inductive step for the Koszul-style alternating-sum argument. -/

/-- Iter-055: producer for `HasAffineCechAcyclicCover` from existence of basic-open
Čech-acyclic cover.

Given that for every affine open `U` of `C.left` there exists a spanning subset
`s ⊆ Γ(C.left, U)` with `Ideal.span s = ⊤` such that the basic-open cover
`basicOpenCover s : s → Opens` carries both `IsCechAcyclicCover F (basicOpenCover s)`
and `HasCechToHModuleIso F (basicOpenCover s)`, conclude `HasAffineCechAcyclicCover F`.

Iter-055 specialises iter-053's existence-bundled cover form to the basic-open cover
shape constructed iter-054. Strategic value: factors out the existence-bundling step
from iter-056+ substantive work, so the iter-056+ Koszul acyclicity branch and the
iter-057+ Čech-vs-derived comparison branch can each prove specifically the basic-open
form (which the universal Koszul + comparison arguments naturally produce), and the
iter-055 producer then bundles their results into iter-053's carrier shape automatically.

Body: destructures the per-affine existence to obtain `(s, hs, hacy, hcomp)`, then
bundles them into iter-053's existential cover via iter-054's
`basicOpenCover_supr_of_span_eq_top` to produce the supremum hypothesis. -/

/-- Iter-055: curve specialisation of `hasAffineCechAcyclicCover_of_basicOpen` at
`F := toModuleKSheaf C`.

Mirrors the iter-039/042/043/048/049/050/051/052/053 `_curve` pattern: a thin
dot-notation wrapper that saves call sites in the curve setting (where `F` is the
structure sheaf) from re-typing `toModuleKSheaf C` whenever the iter-055 producer
is chained through. Used by the iter-057+ packaging step to instantiate
`HasAffineCechAcyclicCover (toModuleKSheaf C)` once iter-056+ supplies the
per-affine basic-open Čech-acyclic + comparison-iso evidence. -/

/-- Iter-056: pairwise basic-open intersection identification.

Given a Set `s ⊆ Γ(C.left, U)` and indices `i j : s`, the intersection of the
two basic-open cover members `basicOpenCover s i` and `basicOpenCover s j`
equals the basic open of the product `i.1 * j.1`. Direct iteration of Mathlib's
`Scheme.basicOpen_mul`.

This is the foundational identification for iter-057+ Čech complex evaluation:
the Čech cochain at degree 1 indexes pairs `(i, j) : s × s` and assigns the
sheaf evaluated at `basicOpenCover s i ⊓ basicOpenCover s j`. Via this lemma,
that intersection is identified with `C.left.basicOpen (i.1 * j.1)`, which by
`IsAffineOpen.isLocalization_of_eq_basicOpen` (Mathlib) is the localization
`Localization.Away (i.1 * j.1)` of `Γ(C.left, U)`. The Koszul-style
alternating-sum exactness on these localizations follows from
`exact_of_localized_span` (Mathlib) under `Ideal.span s = ⊤`. -/

Given `(hU : IsAffineOpen U)`, `(s : Set Γ(C.left, U))`, and indices `i j : s`,
the intersection `basicOpenCover s i ⊓ basicOpenCover s j` is itself affine.
Thin wrapper combining `basicOpenCover_inter_eq_basicOpen_mul` (rewriting the
intersection as a basic open of the product) with Mathlib's
`IsAffineOpen.basicOpen` (membership preservation under basic-open formation).

Generalises iter-054's `basicOpenCover_isAffineOpen` (single-index affine
membership) to pairwise intersections. Used by iter-057+ Čech evaluation: each
finite intersection of basic opens is itself affine, which is the inductive
step for the Koszul alternating-sum argument (Stacks 03F7 / Hartshorne III.4.5
/ Eisenbud Commutative Algebra §17 Koszul resolution). -/

/-- Iter-057: n-ary basic-open intersection identification (Finset.inf' form).

Given a non-empty `Finset t : Finset s`, the infimum (over `t`) of the basic-open
cover members `basicOpenCover s i` for `i ∈ t` equals the basic open of the
finite product `∏ i ∈ t, i.1` in `Γ(C.left, U)`. Generalises iter-056's binary
`basicOpenCover_inter_eq_basicOpen_mul` to arbitrary non-empty Finset indexing.

Body via `Finset.cons_induction`: the empty case is impossible by `t.Nonempty`
(closed via `Finset.not_nonempty_empty`); the cons case splits on whether the
residual `t` is empty or non-empty (via `Finset.eq_empty_or_nonempty`). In the
empty residual case, `simp [basicOpenCover]` closes via single-element reduction
of `Finset.inf'` and `Finset.prod`. In the non-empty residual case, decompose
via `Finset.inf'_cons hne` to expose `basicOpenCover s a ⊓ rest`, decompose
`Finset.prod_cons` to expose `a.1 * (∏ i ∈ t, i.1)`, apply the IH to identify
`rest = C.left.basicOpen (∏ i ∈ t, i.1)`, then `change ... ⊓ _ = _` followed by
`rw [← Scheme.basicOpen_mul]` consolidates the product form.

This is the foundational identification for iter-058+ Čech complex evaluation
at arbitrary degree `n`: the Čech cochain at degree `n` indexes `x : Fin (n+1) → s`
and assigns the sheaf evaluated at `⨅ i : Fin (n+1), basicOpenCover s (x i)`.
Via this lemma (instantiated at `t := (Finset.univ : Finset (Fin (n+1))).image x`,
or more directly via `Finset.univ.inf' Finset.univ_nonempty (basicOpenCover s ∘ x)`),
that intersection identifies with `C.left.basicOpen (∏ i : Fin (n+1), (x i).1)`,
which by `IsAffineOpen.isLocalization_of_eq_basicOpen` (Mathlib) is the
localization `Localization.Away (∏ i, (x i).1)` of `Γ(C.left, U)`. -/

Given `(hU : IsAffineOpen U)`, `(s : Set Γ(C.left, U))`, `(t : Finset s)`, and
`(h : t.Nonempty)`, the n-ary intersection `t.inf' h (basicOpenCover s)` is
itself affine. Term-mode body chains
`basicOpenCover_finset_inf'_eq_basicOpen_prod` (rewriting the n-ary intersection
as a basic open of the finite product) with Mathlib's `IsAffineOpen.basicOpen`
(membership preservation under basic-open formation).

Generalises iter-056's `basicOpenCover_inter_isAffineOpen` (pairwise affine
membership) to arbitrary non-empty Finset indexing. Used by iter-058+ Čech
evaluation: each finite intersection of basic opens of an affine is itself
affine, which is the inductive step for the Koszul alternating-sum argument
(Stacks 03F7 / Hartshorne III.4.5 / Eisenbud Commutative Algebra §17 Koszul
resolution).

**Body uses `▸` (Eq.mpr), NOT `rw`**: `rw` on the equation produced by Theorem
(1) fails because of motive-occurrence issues with the implicit `Subtype.val`
coercions on elements of `Finset s`; term-mode `▸` rewrite resolves these
directly without invoking the rewriter's pattern-matching. Plan-agent
`lean_run_code` probe (this pass) confirmed the term-mode form compiles
kernel-only while the tactic-mode `rw` form fails with "Did not find an
occurrence of the pattern" error. -/

/-- Iter-058: n-ary basic-open intersection is contained in `U`.

Given a non-empty `Finset t : Finset s`, the infimum (over `t`) of the basic-open
cover members `basicOpenCover s i` for `i ∈ t` is contained in `U`. Term-mode
body chains iter-057's `basicOpenCover_finset_inf'_eq_basicOpen_prod` (rewriting
the n-ary intersection as a single basic open of the finite product) with
Mathlib's `Scheme.basicOpen_le` (`X.basicOpen f ≤ U` for any `f ∈ Γ(X, U)`)
via Lean's `▸` (Eq.mpr) rewrite.

**No `IsAffineOpen` hypothesis required**: `basicOpen_le` holds for any open `U`
(the basic open of `f ∈ Γ(X, U)` is always a sub-open of `U`); compare iter-057's
`basicOpenCover_finset_inf'_isAffineOpen` which does need `(hU : IsAffineOpen U)`.

This is the inclusion morphism iter-059+ Čech-evaluation arguments need when
applying Mathlib's `IsAffineOpen.isLocalization_of_eq_basicOpen`:
```
(hU : IsAffineOpen U) (f : Γ(X, U)) {V : X.Opens} (i : V ⟶ U) :
  V = X.basicOpen f → IsLocalization.Away f Γ(X, V)
```
The morphism `i : V ⟶ U` argument (which is `homOfLE` of `V ≤ U`) is needed to
install the `Algebra Γ(X, U) Γ(X, V)` instance for the conclusion type, since
Mathlib's `algebra_section_section_basicOpen` instance only fires for the
syntactic form `Γ(X, X.basicOpen f)`, not for `V = t.inf' h (basicOpenCover s)`.
Iter-058's inclusion lemma supplies this `V ≤ U` proof so iter-059+ can call
`hU.isLocalization_of_eq_basicOpen f (homOfLE (basicOpenCover_finset_inf'_le ...))
(basicOpenCover_finset_inf'_eq_basicOpen_prod ...)` to land
`IsLocalization.Away (∏ i ∈ t, i.1) Γ(C.left, t.inf' h (basicOpenCover s))`
directly. -/

/-- Iter-059: n-ary basic-open intersection is a localization.

Given an affine open `U`, a subset `s ⊆ Γ(C.left, U)`, and a non-empty `Finset t : Finset s`,
the structure sheaf evaluated on the n-ary intersection of basic-open cover members
`t.inf' h (basicOpenCover s)` is identified — as a localization away from the product
`∏ i ∈ t, i.1` of generators — with `Γ(C.left, U)`. The algebra structure on the conclusion
type is given explicitly by `(C.left.presheaf.map (homOfLE _).op).hom.toAlgebra`, threaded
through the conclusion `@IsLocalization.Away _ _ f Γ(X, V) _ algebra` form (matching
Mathlib's `IsAffineOpen.isLocalization_of_eq_basicOpen` signature exactly).

**Explicit `@`-algebra binding is essential.** Mathlib's default
`algebra_section_section_basicOpen` instance (`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme.lean` L724)
fires only for the syntactic form `Γ(X, X.basicOpen f)`, *not* for arbitrary `V`
definitionally equal to `X.basicOpen f`. The iter-058 plan-agent probe-confirmed that
stating this theorem with *inferred* algebra fails with
`failed to synthesize instance of type class Algebra Γ(C.left, U) Γ(C.left, t.inf' h …)`.
Threading the algebra structure as part of the conclusion type — matching Mathlib's
signature exactly — sidesteps the synthesis attempt.

This is the **fourth and final** thin foundational scaffolding helper on the affine
basic-open identification side. The iter-060+ basic-open Koszul acyclicity argument
(per the iter-059 analogy report at `analogies/cech-koszul-precedent.md`, Branch A
substep 2) chains iter-057's equality + iter-058's inclusion + iter-059's localization
+ `IsLocalizedModule.map_exact` (`Mathlib/Algebra/Module/LocalizedModule/Exact.lean`)

/-- Iter-066 helper: in `ModuleCat k`, a product projection induced by an
injection of index sets is a split epi.

Given an injection `f : β → α` and a family `M : α → ModuleCat k`, the natural
projection `∏ᶜ_a M a ⟶ ∏ᶜ_b M (f b)` defined as `Pi.lift (fun b => Pi.π M (f b))`
(which sends a tuple indexed by `α` to its `image f` components, reindexed by `β`)
admits a section in `ModuleCat k`. The section is the "extend by zero" map:
given a tuple indexed by `β`, fill in the components in `image f` (using the
unique preimage given by injectivity of `f`) and set the remaining components
to `0`.

This is the categorical fact underlying `h_π_split` in
`basicOpenCover_isCechAcyclicCover_toModuleKSheaf`: the cochain-complex map
`π : K ⟶ K₀` is at each degree of this form (the `↑s₀ ↪ s` inclusion induces a
postcomposition map `(Fin (i+1) → ↑s₀) → (Fin (i+1) → s)` which is injective by
injectivity of the inclusion, hence the induced product projection on cochain
factors is split).

The helper is stated for a generic injection so it can be reused for both the
`s` substep (`h_π_split` proper) and the slice-cover variants. -/

/-- Iter-102 refactor (cechcoface-named-family): extracted top-level family for the
sign-free Čech coface morphism components. The body is the `Pi.lift fun i_1 ↦ ...`
expression that appears (anonymously) in the post-iter-099 expanded
Čech differential inside `cechCofaceMap_pi_smul`.

Naming this family makes the head symbol a defined constant rather than
an anonymous closure, which unblocks the iter-099 `_sum_comp` /
`alternating_zsmul_pi_smul_aux_sum_comp` call-site application:
- Miller unification on the G slot becomes trivial (G is given explicitly).
- The per-summand R-linearity hypothesis is a separate top-level theorem
  (`cechCofaceMap_summand_family_R_linear` below) that proves R-linearity
  of the named family at the binder level (HOU-free).

The codomain index `Fin ((ComplexShape.up ℕ).prev n + 2) → ↑s₀` keeps the
definition independent of `hn : 0 < n` — it is the natural domain of
`(SimplexCategory.δ i).toOrderHom` for `i : Fin ((ComplexShape.up ℕ).prev n + 2)`.
The call site bridges to `Fin (n + 1) → ↑s₀` via the existing `eqToHom`
slot fed into `E` of `alternating_zsmul_pi_smul_aux_sum_comp`. -/

/-- Iter-102 refactor (cechcoface-named-family): per-summand R-linearity of the
sign-free Čech coface component `cechCofaceMap_summand_family`. The R-action on
the domain (`∏ᶜ Z₁`-side) is the Pi.module structure with each factor's
restriction-algebra structure; the R-action on the codomain (`∏ᶜ Z_int`-side) is
similarly the Pi.module structure with each factor's restriction-algebra
structure. The morphism factors through
`Pi.π Z_pre (i_1 ∘ δ i) ≫ presheaf.map _.op`, so R-linearity follows per
coordinate from `presheafMap_restrict_collapse` + `Pi.lift_π_apply`.

Body closed iter-104 via a ~50-LOC binder-level proof: body-local `letI`
reconstruction of `perI₁`/`perI_int`/`h_mod_pi₁`/`h_mod_pi_int` so the `r • _`
HSMul synthesises against the same `Pi.module` instances baked into the goal;
`funext j'` reduces to per-coordinate equality; `simp only [Pi.smul_apply]`
plus a `show (Pi.π Z_int j').hom ⋯ = r • (Pi.π Z_int j').hom ⋯` pivot exposes
the per-coord projection form; `unfold cechCofaceMap_summand_family` followed
by `simp only [Limits.Pi.lift_π_apply, ConcreteCategory.comp_apply]` peels the
outer `Pi.π` and splits the categorical composition; a body-local `hSym`
(derived from `ModuleCat.piIsoPi_inv_kernel_ι_apply`) rewrites
`(Pi.π Z₁ a).hom (e₁.symm Z) = Z a` on both sides; `simp only [Pi.smul_apply,
RingHom.toModule_smul]` exposes the ring-hom view of `•`; the final step is a
term-level `Eq.trans` chain combining `(presheaf.map Pl.op).hom.map_mul` with
`congrArg` and `presheafMap_restrict_collapse`, bypassing tactic-level HMul
synthesis on the output ring. -/

/-- Iter-096 (refactor extraction): structural lemma — if each summand
`F i` is R-linear (with respect to the LinearEquivs `e₁`, `e₂`), then
so is `∑ i ∈ s, F i`. The summand family `F : ι' → (M ⟶ N)` is named
abstractly, so applying this lemma to the Čech alternating sum
`∑ i, (-1)^↑i • Pi.lift fun i_1 ↦ ...` only requires Miller-pattern
unification `F := fun i ↦ <literal summand>` — no HOU on the
nested-i body.

Body closed iter-097 via `Finset.cons_induction` on `s` with a simultaneous
`simp only` rewrite on both sides of the conclusion: the empty case collapses
through `Finset.sum_empty`, `ModuleCat.hom_zero`, `LinearMap.zero_apply`,
`map_zero`, and `smul_zero`; the cons step normalises the LHS/RHS in one pass
via `Finset.sum_cons`, `ModuleCat.hom_add`, `LinearMap.add_apply`, `map_add`,
then closes by chaining the per-summand hypothesis `hF i ⋯` on the head with
the induction hypothesis on the tail and a final `smul_add`. HOU-free because
`F` is a binder.

**Refactor note (iter-096):** The directive also requested a companion
`cechCofaceMap_pi_smul_summand` that bakes the Čech summand literal
into its signature. That signature triggers a whnf timeout at the
`Pi.lift (fun x ↦ Pi.π (basicOpenCover ↑s₀ ∘ i_1) ((SimplexCategory.δ i)
.toOrderHom x))`-elaboration step, because Lean attempts to unify
`Fin ((ComplexShape.up ℕ).prev n + 1) → ↥s₀` with `Fin n → ↥s₀` through
the heavy `ComplexShape.prev` definition. We omit that helper in iter-096;
the abstract structural lemma below suffices to give the iter-097 prover a
HOU-friendly hook (instantiate `F := fun i ↦ <Čech summand>` and discharge
per-summand R-linearity inline). -/

/-- Iter-098 refactor: sum-through-composition extension of
`alternating_sum_pi_smul_aux`. The existing lemma's single morphism
family `F : ι' → ((∏ᶜ Z₁) ⟶ (∏ᶜ Z₂))` cannot absorb an intermediate
`eqToHom` because instantiating `F := fun i ↦ G i ≫ eqToHom`
re-introduces a `Fin (...) → ↑s₀` vs `Fin (n + 1) → ↑s₀` unification
problem outside tactic state (the iter-097 Attempt 5 dead-end). This
parallel lemma splits the morphism into a family `G : ι' → ((∏ᶜ Z₁) ⟶
(∏ᶜ Z_int))` plus a single `E : (∏ᶜ Z_int) ⟶ (∏ᶜ Z₂)`, so the
`eqToHom` slot at the call site lands in `E` (an independent
elaboration slot) rather than inside the family.

/-- Iter-102 refactor: zsmul-through-composition extension of
`alternating_sum_pi_smul_aux_sum_comp`. Adds a per-summand sign
`σ : ι' → ℤ` as a separate binder so that the per-summand R-linearity
hypothesis `hG` is about the **sign-free** composite `G i ≫ E` rather than
the sign-wrapped `(σ i • G i) ≫ E`. The body internally handles the
sign-to-R-action commutativity at the binder level, where Lean's
discrimination tree has no anonymous-closure to choke on.

This unblocks the `cechCofaceMap_pi_smul` `?hG` discharge: the iter-099
call site bakes `(-1)^↑i` into `?G`, leading to a discharge that requires
`Preadditive.zsmul_comp` on a Pi.lift with anonymous-closure codomain —
three consecutive prover lanes (iter-099, iter-100, iter-101) failed on
this class. With the new lemma, the discharge is about the sign-free
`Pi.lift_thing_i ≫ eqToHom`, which is closed via
`presheafMap_restrict_collapse` per coordinate.

discharged inline by a `show` pivot followed by `map_zsmul e₂ (σ i)` on both
sides plus `hG i hi r y` and `smul_comm (σ i) r` for the σ-vs-r commutation. -/

/-- Iter-087 (refactor, CORRECTIVE): R-linearity of the Čech-cochain
differential at degree `(prev n, n)` in the product representation, specialized
to the project's Čech-cochain context (`basicOpenCover` of an affine `U` from a
spanning finset `s₀`).

**Statement specialization.** The previous iter-087 abstraction quantified
universally over `(Z₁, Z₂, e₁, e₂, scK₀_f, h_mod_pi₁, h_mod_pi₂, R)`, yielding
a mathematically false statement for arbitrary `scK₀_f`. This corrective
version fixes `R`, `K₀`, `scK₀`, `Z_i`, `e_i`, `h_mod_pi_i` from the
Čech-cochain context, so the conclusion is mathematically true: the Čech
differential is a finite alternating sum of presheaf restriction maps, each
R-linear (see `presheafMap_restrict_collapse`), hence the sum is R-linear
componentwise.

The body is `sorry`; the iter-088+ prover closes it. The duplicated `letI`
block (perI₁/h_mod_pi₁/perI₂/h_mod_pi₂) mirrors the inline let-block inside
`basicOpenCover_isCechAcyclicCover_toModuleKSheaf` so the call site
`cechCofaceMap_pi_smul hU s₀ hn` produces a term that definitionally matches
the local `h_diff_pi_smul_f` shape used at the consumer (`f_R.map_smul'`). -/

/-- Iter-060 (Phase A step 6 / Path 2 — **substantive Čech acyclicity attempt**):
the basic-open cover of an affine open `U` by a spanning subset `s ⊆ Γ(C.left, U)`
gives a Čech-acyclic cover for the `ModuleCat k`-valued structure sheaf
`toModuleKSheaf C`. This is the Stacks 01ED Čech-acyclicity theorem for affine
schemes in our setting.

**Mathematical content (Stacks 01ED route).** For each positive degree `n`,
exactness of the Čech cochain at degree `n` is a *local* property on the
spanning set `s`. Localising the Čech complex at any `f ∈ s` exhibits the
slice over `D(f)` as a Čech complex of an affine cover whose terminal vertex
`D(f) → D(f)` supplies an *extra degeneracy* (Mathlib's
`FormalCoproduct.extraDegeneracyCech`). By
`SimplicialObject.Augmented.ExtraDegeneracy.homotopyEquiv` the augmented
chain complex of the slice is homotopy equivalent to the constant complex on
the augmentation, hence exact in positive degrees. Re-globalising via
`exact_of_isLocalized_span` (Mathlib `RingTheory/LocalProperties/Exactness.lean`
L173) yields exactness of the *unlocalised* Čech complex at degree `n`.

The structural skeleton is:
* reduce `Subsingleton (cechCohomology n)` to `ExactAt (cechCochain) n` via
  `cechCohomology_subsingleton_of_cechCochain_exactAt`;
* the substantive `ExactAt n` is decomposed into three substeps tracked by
  separate `sorry`s, each annotated with the missing computational step.

**Transient sorries (iter-060)** — explicitly endorsed by the iteration
directive; each sorry names a substep. The substeps are:
  (a) **local exactness at `D(f)`** (extra-degeneracy invocation): given the
      cover-of-`D(f)` slice, build the augmented Čech simplicial object,
      apply `FormalCoproduct.extraDegeneracyCech` to obtain an
      `ExtraDegeneracy`, then transport via
      `ExtraDegeneracy.homotopyEquiv` and op-passage `CochainComplex.opEquivalence`
      to get cochain-level exactness in positive degrees;
  (b) **localised-Čech identification**: the localisation at `f` of the
      degree-`n` Čech cochain is the degree-`n` cochain of the cover-of-`D(f)`
      Čech complex, via iter-057+ identifications chained with
      `IsLocalizedModule.map_exact`;
  (c) **local-to-global** via `exact_of_isLocalized_span`: the assembled
      family of per-`f` local exactnesses lifts to global exactness.

The decomposition follows §"Branch A — Čech acyclicity" of
