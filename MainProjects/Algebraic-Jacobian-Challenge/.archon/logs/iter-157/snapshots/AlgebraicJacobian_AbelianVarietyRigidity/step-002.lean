# Abelian-variety rigidity: morphisms from a genus-`0` curve into an abelian variety are constant

This file scaffolds the project's **committed characteristic-free** genus-`0` route
(route (c)): the abelian-variety rigidity stack. It sits **upstream** of
`AlgebraicJacobian.Jacobian` (it imports only `AlgebraicJacobian.Genus`), breaking the
`RigidityKbar → Rigidity → Jacobian` import cycle so that `genusZeroWitness` can consume the
genus-`0` rigidity keystone directly.

The headline `rigidity_genus0_curve_to_grpScheme` is the char-free replacement (no
`[CharZero kbar]`) for `AlgebraicGeometry.rigidity_over_kbar` of `AlgebraicJacobian.RigidityKbar`
(which remains in tree as the fallback route (a) artifact and still carries `[CharZero]`).

The minimal chain has four links, all scaffolded here as `sorry`:

1. `rigidity_lemma` — the Rigidity Lemma (Mumford, Form I): the cube-free, cohomology-free
   properness/closed-map entry point.
2. `morphism_P1_to_grpScheme_const` — every morphism `ℙ¹ → A` into an abelian variety is
   constant (blocked downstream on the theorem of the cube).
3. `genusZero_curve_iso_P1` — a smooth proper geom-irred genus-`0` curve over `k̄` is
   isomorphic to `ℙ¹` (blocked on Riemann–Roch).
4. `rigidity_genus0_curve_to_grpScheme` — THE HEADLINE consumed by `genusZeroWitness`.

## Encoding notes (iter-157 scaffold)

Mathlib `b80f227` packages no `ℙ¹` as a `Scheme`, so — following the established project idiom
(see `AlgebraicJacobian.RigidityKbar`) — the projective line is encoded by its abstract
characterisation: a smooth proper geometrically irreducible `Over (Spec (.of kbar))` of relative
dimension `1` with `genus = 0`. The signatures of declarations 1–3 are **provisional**
(`SCAFFOLD` comments mark them); the prover may refine the encoding when the bodies are filled.
Declaration 4 is pinned verbatim to `rigidity_over_kbar`'s signature minus `[CharZero kbar]`,
because it is the exact signature the consumer (`genusZeroWitness.key`) needs.

/-- **Geometric core of the Rigidity Lemma (honestly deferred).** With `X` complete (proper)
and `x₀ : 𝟙_ ⟶ X` a `k̄`-point, the morphism `f : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Z` is invariant under the
"collapse-the-`X`-axis-onto-`x₀`" endomorphism `retract := lift (toUnit (X ⊗ Y) ≫ x₀) (snd X Y)`:

  `f = retract ≫ f`,

i.e. `f(x, y) = f(x₀, y)` for all `(x, y)` — `f` depends only on the `Y`-coordinate. This is
the entirety of the *geometric* content of Mumford's Rigidity Lemma (Form I); the rest of
`rigidity_lemma` is the cartesian-monoidal algebra discharged by `rigidity_snd_lift`.

## Mumford's proof of this core (Abelian Varieties, Ch. II §4, p. 43)

Set `g(y) = f(x₀, y)` (so `retract ≫ f` is exactly `(x, y) ↦ g(y)`). To prove `f = retract ≫ f`
it suffices, since `X ⊗ Y` is a variety (reduced + irreducible) and `Z` is separated, to prove
agreement on a non-empty open `X × V ⊆ X ⊗ Y` (then `Scheme.Over.ext_of_eqOnOpen` of
`AlgebraicJacobian.Rigidity` finishes — it needs `[GeometricallyIrreducible (X ⊗ Y).hom]`,
`[IsReduced (X ⊗ Y).left]`, `[IsSeparated Z.hom]`). The open `V` is produced as follows:
let `U` be an affine open neighbourhood of a chosen point in `Z`, `F = Z ∖ U`, and
`G = (snd X Y) '' (f ⁻¹ F)`. Then for each `y ∈ V := Y ∖ G`, the slice `f(X × {y}) ⊆ U`.

This rests on **two Mathlib bridges still to be built** (the cube-free heart):

  1. **Properness ⇒ the projection is a closed map.** `IsProper X.hom` is universally closed,
     and `snd X Y` is the base change of `X.hom` along `Y.hom`, hence universally/closed; so
     `G = snd '' (closed)` is closed and `V` is open. Mathlib has `IsProper`/`UniversallyClosed`
     API and base-change stability; the missing glue is identifying the monoidal `snd X Y` in
     `Over (Spec k̄)` with the scheme-theoretic pullback projection and transporting
     `IsClosedMap`. (Search: `UniversallyClosed`, `IsProper`, `MorphismProperty.pullback`,
     `Limits.pullback.snd`.)

  2. **A proper connected variety mapping to an affine has image a single point.** For `y ∈ V`,
     the proper connected `X × {y}` maps under `f` into the affine `U`; a global regular function
     on a proper connected (geometrically connected reduced) `k̄`-scheme is constant
     (`Γ(X) = k̄`), so the image is one point, forcing `f(x, y) = f(x₀, y)`. Mathlib likely lacks
     this in usable form; it is a global-sections-constant argument
     (`H⁰` of a proper geometrically-connected reduced scheme over a field is the field).

These are exactly the "two Mathlib bridges to find/build" flagged in `PROGRESS.md`. Both are
char-free (no theorem of the cube, no cohomology beyond `H⁰`). Until they land, this core is the
sole `sorry` of the Rigidity-Lemma chain. -/

/-- **Rigidity Lemma (Mumford, Form I).** Let `X` be a complete (proper) variety and `Y`, `Z`
any varieties over `k̄`. If `f : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Z` collapses the slice `X × {y₀}` to a single point
`z₀` (encoded as `lift (𝟙 X) (toUnit X ≫ y₀) ≫ f = toUnit X ≫ z₀`), then `f` factors through
the second projection `snd : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Y`, i.e. there is `g : Y ⟶ Z` with `f = snd ≫ g`.

This is the cube-free, cohomology-free entry point of the chain: its only inputs are that
completeness of `X` makes the projection a closed map, and that a proper connected variety has
no nonconstant map to an affine variety. Valid in arbitrary characteristic.

## iter-157 prover progress

The categorical *skeleton* is fully discharged here; only the single geometric core
remains. Concretely, Mumford "chooses any point `x₀ ∈ X`" and sets `g(y) = f(x₀, y)`. We
make this explicit by adding a `k̄`-point `x₀ : 𝟙_ ⟶ X` to the hypotheses (Mumford's
"complete variety `X`" is nonempty, so over `k̄` such a point exists; the downstream
consumer `morphism_P1_to_grpScheme_const` supplies it from `ℙ¹`). The witness is then

  `g := lift (toUnit Y ≫ x₀) (𝟙 Y) ≫ f`   (the section `y ↦ (x₀, y)` post-composed with `f`).

The goal `f = snd X Y ≫ g` rewrites — by pure cartesian-monoidal algebra (`comp_lift`,
`toUnit` uniqueness, `Category.comp_id`) — to

  `f = retract ≫ f`,   where   `retract := lift (toUnit (X ⊗ Y) ≫ x₀) (snd X Y)`

is the endomorphism `(x, y) ↦ (x₀, y)` of `X ⊗ Y` that collapses the `X`-axis onto `x₀`.
This reduction (lemma `rigidity_snd_lift` + `rigidity_reduce`) is closed below. The
remaining `f = retract ≫ f` is the genuine geometric heart (`rigidity_core`): `f` depends
only on the `Y`-coordinate. Its proof is Mumford's properness/closed-map/affine-constant
argument and is the one honestly-deferred obligation — see `rigidity_core` for the full
decomposition into the two Mathlib bridges still to be built.

**Status**: iter-157 — categorical reduction closed; geometric core (`rigidity_core`) is
the sole remaining `sorry`. -/

/-- **A morphism `ℙ¹ → A` is constant.** Over an algebraically closed field `k̄`, every
morphism `f : ℙ¹ ⟶ A` from the projective line into an abelian variety `A` (a smooth proper
geometrically irreducible group scheme) is constant: it factors through a single `k̄`-point
`a₀ : 𝟙_ ⟶ A`, i.e. `f = toUnit ℙ¹ ≫ a₀`.

The single-curve base case of Milne's Proposition 3.10. Cube-free Rigidity-Lemma additivity
drives the multi-factor induction, but the single-curve base rests on the theorem of the cube
(blueprint `thm:theorem_of_the_cube`), recorded there as a deferred deep input.

`k̄`, a smooth proper geometrically irreducible curve `C` with `genus C = 0` is isomorphic — in

Hartshorne's Example IV.1.3.5 (Riemann–Roch). Its formalisation is a genuine sub-build:
Mathlib has no Riemann–Roch for curves.

SCAFFOLD: signature provisional, prover to refine; both `C` and `ℙ¹` are encoded by the

/-- **Headline: rigidity for a pointed genus-`0` curve.** Over an algebraically closed field
`k̄` (arbitrary characteristic — no `[CharZero kbar]`), let `C` be a smooth proper geometrically
irreducible curve with `genus C = 0` and `A` an abelian variety (smooth proper geom-irred group
scheme). Then every morphism `f : C ⟶ A` killing a `k̄`-point `p` (`p ≫ f = η[A]`) equals the
constant morphism at the identity, `f = toUnit C ≫ η[A]`.

This is the project's committed characteristic-free statement that `genusZeroWitness` consumes
(via the `k̄ → k` descent step hosted in `AlgebraicJacobian.Jacobian`). Its signature mirrors
`AlgebraicGeometry.rigidity_over_kbar` of `AlgebraicJacobian.RigidityKbar` **verbatim except**
the `[CharZero kbar]` instance is dropped. Combine `genusZero_curve_iso_P1` (`C ≅ ℙ¹`) with
`morphism_P1_to_grpScheme_const` (`ℙ¹ → A` constant) and pin the constant value to `η[A]` via
the pointed hypothesis. No `df = 0`, no Serre duality, no Picard representability.
