# Abelian-variety rigidity: morphisms from a genus-`0` curve into an abelian variety are constant

This file scaffolds the project's **committed characteristic-free** genus-`0` route
(route (c)): the abelian-variety rigidity stack. It sits **upstream** of
`AlgebraicJacobian.Jacobian` (it imports only `AlgebraicJacobian.Genus`), breaking the
`RigidityKbar → Rigidity → Jacobian` import cycle so that `genusZeroWitness` can consume the
genus-`0` rigidity keystone directly.

The headline `rigidity_genus0_curve_to_grpScheme` is the char-free replacement (no
`[CharZero kbar]`) for `AlgebraicGeometry.rigidity_over_kbar` of `AlgebraicJacobian.RigidityKbar`
(which remains in tree as the fallback route (a) artifact and still carries `[CharZero]`).

The minimal chain has four links, all scaffolded here as `sorry`:

1. `rigidity_lemma` — the Rigidity Lemma (Mumford, Form I): the cube-free, cohomology-free
   properness/closed-map entry point.
2. `morphism_P1_to_grpScheme_const` — every morphism `ℙ¹ → A` into an abelian variety is
   constant (blocked downstream on the theorem of the cube).
3. `genusZero_curve_iso_P1` — a smooth proper geom-irred genus-`0` curve over `k̄` is
   isomorphic to `ℙ¹` (blocked on Riemann–Roch).
4. `rigidity_genus0_curve_to_grpScheme` — THE HEADLINE consumed by `genusZeroWitness`.

See `blueprint/src/chapters/AbelianVarietyRigidity.tex` for the informal sketches and sources
(Mumford, *Abelian Varieties*, Ch. II §4, §6; Milne, *Abelian Varieties*, Prop. 3.10;
Hartshorne, *Algebraic Geometry*, Example IV.1.3.5).

## Encoding notes (iter-157 scaffold)

Mathlib `b80f227` packages no `ℙ¹` as a `Scheme`, so — following the established project idiom
(see `AlgebraicJacobian.RigidityKbar`) — the projective line is encoded by its abstract
characterisation: a smooth proper geometrically irreducible `Over (Spec (.of kbar))` of relative
dimension `1` with `genus = 0`. The signatures of declarations 1–3 are **provisional**
(`SCAFFOLD` comments mark them); the prover may refine the encoding when the bodies are filled.
Declaration 4 is pinned verbatim to `rigidity_over_kbar`'s signature minus `[CharZero kbar]`,
because it is the exact signature the consumer (`genusZeroWitness.key`) needs.

`X × V` together with the slice-constancy `f(x, y) = f(x₀, y)` on it, packaged as the single

`(X ⊗ Y).left` on which `f` and the collapsed map `retract ≫ f` agree as scheme morphisms.

This is where the two char-free Mathlib bridges of `rigidity_core`'s docstring are discharged:
the closed-map argument (`IsProper.toUniversallyClosed` ⟹ the projection is closed) produces the
non-empty open `U = X × V`, and the affine-constancy argument
(`isField_of_universallyClosed` on each proper integral slice mapping to an affine) supplies the
scheme-level equality on `U`. It is the sole remaining `sorry` of the Rigidity-Lemma chain. -/

/-- **Geometric core of the Rigidity Lemma (honestly deferred).** With `X` complete (proper)
and `x₀ : 𝟙_ ⟶ X` a `k̄`-point, the morphism `f : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Z` is invariant under the
"collapse-the-`X`-axis-onto-`x₀`" endomorphism `retract := lift (toUnit (X ⊗ Y) ≫ x₀) (snd X Y)`:

  `f = retract ≫ f`,

i.e. `f(x, y) = f(x₀, y)` for all `(x, y)` — `f` depends only on the `Y`-coordinate. This is
the entirety of the *geometric* content of Mumford's Rigidity Lemma (Form I); the rest of
`rigidity_lemma` is the cartesian-monoidal algebra discharged by `rigidity_snd_lift`.

## Mumford's proof of this core (Abelian Varieties, Ch. II §4, p. 43)

Set `g(y) = f(x₀, y)` (so `retract ≫ f` is exactly `(x, y) ↦ g(y)`). To prove `f = retract ≫ f`
it suffices, since `X ⊗ Y` is a variety (reduced + irreducible) and `Z` is separated, to prove
agreement on a non-empty open `X × V ⊆ X ⊗ Y` (then `Scheme.Over.ext_of_eqOnOpen` of
`AlgebraicJacobian.Rigidity` finishes — it needs `[GeometricallyIrreducible (X ⊗ Y).hom]`,
`[IsReduced (X ⊗ Y).left]`, `[IsSeparated Z.hom]`). The open `V` is produced as follows:
let `U` be an affine open neighbourhood of a chosen point in `Z`, `F = Z ∖ U`, and
`G = (snd X Y) '' (f ⁻¹ F)`. Then for each `y ∈ V := Y ∖ G`, the slice `f(X × {y}) ⊆ U`.

This rests on **two Mathlib bridges still to be built** (the cube-free heart):

  1. **Properness ⇒ the projection is a closed map.** `IsProper X.hom` is universally closed
     (`AlgebraicGeometry.IsProper.toUniversallyClosed`), and `snd X Y` is the base change of
     `X.hom` along `Y.hom`, hence universally closed, hence a closed map
     (`AlgebraicGeometry.UniversallyClosed.universally_isClosedMap` instantiated at the relevant
     pullback square). So `G = snd '' (closed)` is closed and `V` is open. The missing glue is
     identifying the monoidal `snd X Y` in `Over (Spec k̄)` with the scheme-theoretic pullback
     projection `Limits.pullback.snd X.hom Y.hom` and transporting `IsClosedMap` across that
     identification. (Search: `MorphismProperty.pullback`, `Over.tensor`/`Over.cartesian…`,
     `Limits.pullback.snd`.)

  2. **A proper connected variety mapping to an affine has image a single point.** For `y ∈ V`,
     the proper connected slice `X × {y}` maps under `f` into the affine `U`; a global regular
     function on a proper integral `k̄`-scheme is constant. Mathlib *has* the key fact:
     `AlgebraicGeometry.isField_of_universallyClosed` — for `X` integral and `f : X ⟶ Spec K`
     universally closed (`K` a field), `Γ(X, ⊤)` is a field. Combined with `Γ(affine U) → Γ(X×{y})`
     being a `k̄`-algebra map into a field that is finite over `k̄`
     (`AlgebraicGeometry.finite_appTop_of_universallyClosed` under `LocallyOfFiniteType`) and
     `k̄` algebraically closed, the map `X × {y} → U` factors through a single point. This is the
     "global-sections-constant" argument; assembling it into "image is one point" is the
     remaining work.

These are exactly the "two Mathlib bridges to find/build" flagged in `PROGRESS.md`. iter-157
located concrete Mathlib entry points for *both* (named above), upgrading the prior "likely
lacks this" assessment: the obstruction is assembly + the monoidal-`snd`-as-pullback
identification, not absent infrastructure. Both bridges are char-free (no theorem of the cube,
no cohomology beyond `H⁰`). Until they are assembled, this core is the sole `sorry` of the
Rigidity-Lemma chain. -/

/-- **Rigidity Lemma (Mumford, Form I).** Let `X` be a complete (proper) variety and `Y`, `Z`
any varieties over `k̄`. If `f : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Z` collapses the slice `X × {y₀}` to a single point
`z₀` (encoded as `lift (𝟙 X) (toUnit X ≫ y₀) ≫ f = toUnit X ≫ z₀`), then `f` factors through
the second projection `snd : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Y`, i.e. there is `g : Y ⟶ Z` with `f = snd ≫ g`.

This is the cube-free, cohomology-free entry point of the chain: its only inputs are that
completeness of `X` makes the projection a closed map, and that a proper connected variety has
no nonconstant map to an affine variety. Valid in arbitrary characteristic.

SCAFFOLD: signature refined by the iter-157 prover; see blueprint `thm:rigidity_lemma`
(Mumford, *Abelian Varieties*, Ch. II §4, p. 43).

## iter-157 signature correction (the scaffold was false as stated)

The iter-157 scaffold carried only `[IsProper X.hom]`. **That statement is false**: take `X` =
two disjoint reduced `k̄`-points (proper but disconnected), `Y` = two points, `Z = X`, and
`f : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Z` collapsing the `y₀`-fibre to one point while separating the other fibre. Then
`_hf` holds yet `f` does not factor through `snd`. Mumford's hypothesis is that `X` is a complete
**variety** (irreducible) and `Y`, `Z` are **varieties**; the formal statement therefore needs
`X ⊗ Y` geometrically irreducible and reduced (so the dense-open rigidity glue applies) and `Z`
separated (so agreement on a dense open propagates). These three instances are added; they are
exactly what `Scheme.Over.ext_of_eqOnOpen` (the gluing step) consumes, and what Milne's Rigidity
Theorem 1.1 lists ("`V` complete, `V × W` geometrically irreducible, `Z` separated").

## iter-157 prover progress

The categorical *skeleton* is fully discharged here; only the single geometric core
remains. Concretely, Mumford "chooses any point `x₀ ∈ X`" and sets `g(y) = f(x₀, y)`. We
make this explicit by adding a `k̄`-point `x₀ : 𝟙_ ⟶ X` to the hypotheses (Mumford's
"complete variety `X`" is nonempty, so over `k̄` such a point exists; the downstream
consumer `morphism_P1_to_grpScheme_const` supplies it from `ℙ¹`). The witness is then

  `g := lift (toUnit Y ≫ x₀) (𝟙 Y) ≫ f`   (the section `y ↦ (x₀, y)` post-composed with `f`).

The goal `f = snd X Y ≫ g` rewrites — by pure cartesian-monoidal algebra (`comp_lift`,
`toUnit` uniqueness, `Category.comp_id`) — to

  `f = retract ≫ f`,   where   `retract := lift (toUnit (X ⊗ Y) ≫ x₀) (snd X Y)`

is the endomorphism `(x, y) ↦ (x₀, y)` of `X ⊗ Y` that collapses the `X`-axis onto `x₀`.
This reduction (lemma `rigidity_snd_lift`, then one `rw`) is closed below. The
remaining `f = retract ≫ f` is the genuine geometric heart (`rigidity_core`): `f` depends
only on the `Y`-coordinate. Its proof is Mumford's properness/closed-map/affine-constant
argument and is the one honestly-deferred obligation — see `rigidity_core` for the full
decomposition into the two Mathlib bridges still to be built.

**Status**: iter-157 — categorical reduction closed; geometric core (`rigidity_core`) is
the sole remaining `sorry`. -/

`a₀ : 𝟙_ ⟶ A`, i.e. `f = toUnit ℙ¹ ≫ a₀`.

The single-curve base case of Milne's Proposition 3.10. Cube-free Rigidity-Lemma additivity
drives the multi-factor induction, but the single-curve base rests on the theorem of the cube
(blueprint `thm:theorem_of_the_cube`), recorded there as a deferred deep input.
