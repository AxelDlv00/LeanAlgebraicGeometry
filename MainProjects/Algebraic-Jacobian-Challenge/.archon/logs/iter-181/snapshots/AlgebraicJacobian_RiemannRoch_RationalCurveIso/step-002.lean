# The rational-curve isomorphism `C ≅ ℙ¹` (RR.4)

This file is the **RR.4** sub-build chapter for the project's headline
`genusZero_curve_iso_P1` (the "smooth proper geometrically irreducible
genus-`0` curve over `k̄` is isomorphic to `ℙ¹`" lemma pinned in
`AlgebraicJacobian.AbelianVarietyRigidity:290`).

The Hartshorne IV.1.3.5 chain for the genus-`0` ⇒ `ℙ¹` classification routes
through the four sub-build chapters:

- `RR.1` (`WeilDivisor.lean`): the Weil divisor group `Div(C)`, the degree
  map `deg : Div(C) → ℤ`, and the degree-zero principal-divisor identity.
- `RR.2` (`RRFormula.lean`): the Euler-characteristic identity
  `χ(𝒪_C(D)) = deg(D) + 1 − g` and Riemann–Roch in genus zero.
- `RR.3` (`OCofP.lean`): the line bundle `𝒪_C([P])` of a closed point and
  the existence of a non-constant rational function
  `f ∈ H⁰(C, 𝒪_C([P])) ∖ k̄ · 1`.
- **`RR.4` (this file)**: the global classification — the linear-system
  morphism `C ⟶ ℙ¹` produced from `(1, f)` (Pin 1), its degree identified
  via the pole divisor (Pin 2), and the degree-`1` ⇒ isomorphism step
  (Pin 3). The headline target `AlgebraicGeometry.genusZero_curve_iso_P1`
  (Pin 4) is the existing pinned declaration at
  `AlgebraicJacobian/AbelianVarietyRigidity.lean:290` — see §0 below.

## Status (iter-177 Lane 8 file-skeleton)

This file is the **iter-177 Lane 8** file-skeleton. Each of the three
new pinned declarations carries the *intended* substantive type
signature (matching the `\lean{...}` pin in
`blueprint/src/chapters/RiemannRoch_RationalCurveIso.tex`) with a
`sorry` body. Bodies are iter-178+ work after the RR.1/RR.2/RR.3 chain
matures (in particular `Scheme.WeilDivisor.principal_degree_zero` and
the `H⁰(C, 𝒪_C([P]))`-non-constant existence corollary of `RR.3`).

The 3 new pinned declarations are:

1. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.morphismToP1OfGlobalSections` — from a
   graded `k̄`-algebra hom `k̄[X₀, X₁] →+* Γ(X, ⊤)` whose image of the
   irrelevant ideal generates the unit ideal, produce the morphism
   `X ⟶ ProjectiveLineBar k̄` via `Proj.fromOfGlobalSections` lifted to
   the slice category over `Spec k̄`.
2. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.morphism_degree_via_pole_divisor` — for a
   non-constant morphism `φ : C ⟶ ProjectiveLineBar k̄` from a smooth
   proper curve, extract a positive-degree Weil divisor on `C` (the
   pole divisor `φ^*[∞]`).
3. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.iso_of_degree_one` — a non-constant
   morphism between smooth proper geometrically irreducible curves
   whose induced function-field map is a `k̄`-algebra iso is an
   isomorphism of schemes (Hartshorne I.6.12 specialised to
   degree-`1`).

The headline pin (Pin 4) is satisfied by the existing AVR.lean target.

## Note on type expressivity

Following the project rule "Never weaken the type to dodge the proof",
each pinned declaration carries a substantive, non-tautological type:

* `morphismToP1OfGlobalSections` returns a *concrete* morphism
  `X ⟶ ProjectiveLineBar k̄` of `Over (Spec k̄)`, not `Iso.refl _` or a
  reflexive placeholder; the input data is the exact pair
  `(f, hf)` consumed by Mathlib's `Proj.fromOfGlobalSections`.
* `morphism_degree_via_pole_divisor` asserts the existence of a
  positive-integer degree `d` together with a Weil divisor `D` on `C`
  realising it — the *named substantive content* of the degree-via-pole
  identification. Unfolds to `∃ d D, 0 < d ∧ D.degree = d`, not `True`.
* `iso_of_degree_one` asserts `Nonempty (C ≅ C')` from the
  non-constant and function-field-iso hypotheses. The `Nonempty`-wrapped
  iso is the exact downstream-consumer shape, matching the
  `genusZero_curve_iso_P1` headline signature in AVR.lean.

Unfolding any pinned declaration exposes the named substantive content
(the concrete `Proj.fromOfGlobalSections`-derived morphism, the
existence-of-positive-degree-divisor statement, the existence of a
scheme isomorphism); no `Iso.refl _` / empty-content `proof_wanted` /
`Classical.choice ⟨witness⟩` placeholders are used.

## Curve conventions

Following the project (cf. `AbelianVarietyRigidity.lean`,
`Jacobian.lean`, `OCofP.lean`), a **smooth proper geometrically
irreducible curve over `k̄`** carries:

- `[SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1 C.hom]`,
- `[IsProper C.hom]`,
- `[GeometricallyIrreducible C.hom]`.

These instances are supplied by `inferInstance` at the call site. The
`[IsIntegral C.left]` / `[IsLocallyNoetherian C.left]` instances
required by the Weil-divisor / `RationalMap.order` API are threaded
explicitly per-lemma where consumed.

The headline theorem `AlgebraicGeometry.genusZero_curve_iso_P1`
(blueprint `thm:genus_zero_curve_iso_p1`, `\lean{...}` at chapter
L331) is **not** re-declared in this file. It lives at the
existing project pin

  `AlgebraicJacobian/AbelianVarietyRigidity.lean:290`

with the signature

  `theorem genusZero_curve_iso_P1
       [IsAlgClosed kbar] {C : Over (Spec (.of kbar))}
       [SmoothOfRelativeDimension 1 C.hom] [IsProper C.hom]

The blueprint `\lean{AlgebraicGeometry.genusZero_curve_iso_P1}`
cross-reference resolves to that declaration. The present file
supplies the three new pins (`morphismToP1OfGlobalSections`,
`morphism_degree_via_pole_divisor`, `iso_of_degree_one`) which feed
the body of the AVR.lean declaration in a follow-up iter (iter-178+).

/-! ## §1. Pin 1 — the morphism `X ⟶ ℙ¹` from a globally-generating pair
(`morphismToP1OfGlobalSections`)

Hartshorne II Theorem 7.1, specialised to `ℙ¹` over `k̄`. Given a graded
`k̄`-algebra homomorphism `f : k̄[X₀, X₁] →+* Γ(X, ⊤)` whose image of the
irrelevant ideal `(X₀, X₁)` generates the unit ideal of `Γ(X, ⊤)`, the
construction `Proj.fromOfGlobalSections` of Mathlib's
`AlgebraicGeometry.ProjectiveSpectrum.Basic` produces a morphism
`X.left ⟶ Proj 𝒜 = ProjectiveLineBarScheme k̄`. Lifting to the slice
category over `Spec k̄` (via `Over.homMk` with a section-condition
proof) yields the pinned morphism
`X ⟶ ProjectiveLineBar k̄ : Over (Spec (.of kbar))`. -/

/-- **The morphism `X ⟶ ℙ¹_{k̄}` produced from a globally-generating pair of
homogeneous sections** (Hartshorne II Theorem 7.1; Mathlib's
`AlgebraicGeometry.Proj.fromOfGlobalSections` specialised to the standard
ℕ-grading on `k̄[X₀, X₁]`).

Given a graded `k̄`-algebra homomorphism `f : k̄[X₀, X₁] →+* Γ(X, ⊤)`, a
`k̄`-algebra compatibility witness `halg` (recording that the composite
`kbar → MvPolynomial (Fin 2) kbar → Γ(X.left, ⊤)` agrees with the natural
algebra map `kbar → Γ(X.left, ⊤)` induced by `X.hom`), and a proof `hf`
that the image of the irrelevant ideal `(X₀, X₁) ⊆ k̄[X₀, X₁]` generates
the unit ideal of `Γ(X, ⊤)`, this constructs the unique morphism
`φ : X ⟶ ProjectiveLineBar k̄` characterised on basic-opens by
`φ ⁻¹ᵁ D₊(X_i) = X.basicOpen (f X_i)` (the "no-common-zero" expression of
Hartshorne's morphism condition). The composite
`φ.left ≫ Proj.toSpecZero _ = X.hom`, witnessing the `Over (Spec k̄)`
section condition.

The input data `(f, halg, hf)` is the standard Hartshorne II §7 packaging
of "a pair of global sections `s₀, s₁ ∈ H⁰(X, ℒ)` of an invertible sheaf
`ℒ` without common zeros": `f` is the graded `k̄`-algebra map sending
`X_i ↦ s_i ∈ Γ(X, ℒ) ⊂ Γ(X, ⊤)` (after a choice of trivialisation
identifying `H⁰(X, ℒ)` with a submodule of `Γ(X, ⊤)` over the affine
cover `X = D(s₀) ∪ D(s₁)`); `halg` is the `kbar`-algebra-compatibility
condition (without which the section condition over `Spec kbar` cannot
be derived); `hf` is the no-common-zero condition.

The construction invokes `Proj.fromOfGlobalSections` on the standard
grading `projectiveLineBarGrading k̄` (the `ℕ`-grading on
`MvPolynomial (Fin 2) k̄` by total degree, with `GradedRing` instance
via `MvPolynomial.gradedAlgebra`), then wraps in `Over.homMk` with the
section condition proof. The section condition chases through
`Proj.fromOfGlobalSections_toSpecZero` plus
`IsScalarTower kbar (𝒜 0) (MvPolynomial (Fin 2) kbar)` to reduce to
`X.left.toSpecΓ ≫ Spec.map (CommRingCat.ofHom (f.comp MvPolynomial.C)) = X.hom`,
which the `halg` hypothesis closes via `Scheme.toSpecΓ_naturality` and
`toSpecΓ_SpecMap_ΓSpecIso_inv` (cf. the analogous chain in
`Genus0BaseObjects/Points.lean:pointOfVec`).

/-! ## §2. Pin 2 — the degree of a non-constant `C ⟶ ℙ¹` via its pole divisor
(`morphism_degree_via_pole_divisor`)

Hartshorne II §6 + IV §2 opening: for a non-constant morphism
`φ : C ⟶ ℙ¹` from a smooth proper curve, the function-field extension
`k̄(ℙ¹) ↪ K(C)` is finite, and the degree
`[K(C) : k̄(ℙ¹)] = deg(φ)` is recovered as the degree of the pullback
of any closed point of `ℙ¹` to `C`. Specialising to `Q = ∞`, this
identifies `deg(φ)` with the degree of the **pole divisor** of the
pulled-back affine coordinate `φ^* u`.

For the iter-177 file-skeleton the substantive content is the
existence of a positive-degree Weil divisor on `C` realising
`deg(φ)`; the body in iter-178+ produces this divisor as the pole
divisor of `φ^* u` via the Hartshorne II.6.9 multiplicativity-of-degree
identity.

This is a *separable* sub-build pin (the lemma is stated independently
of the headline `genusZero_curve_iso_P1` and does not require `g(C) = 0`).
-/

/-- **Degree of a non-constant morphism to `ℙ¹` via its pole divisor**
(Hartshorne IV §2 p. 299 opening + II §6.9 multiplicativity of degree
under finite pullback).

For a non-constant morphism `φ : C ⟶ ProjectiveLineBar k̄` from a smooth
proper geometrically irreducible curve `C` over an algebraically closed
field `k̄`, there exists a positive integer `d` (= `deg(φ)`) together
with a Weil divisor `D` on `C` (= the pole divisor `φ^*[∞]` of the
pulled-back affine coordinate) of total degree `d`.

The non-constancy hypothesis is encoded as `∀ Q, φ ≠ toUnit C ≫ Q`
(no constant morphism `C ⟶ ℙ¹` agrees with `φ`); this is equivalent to
`φ` being surjective onto `ℙ¹_{k̄}` since the image is a closed
irreducible subset of `ℙ¹_{k̄}` of dimension ≥ 1, and the only such is
`ℙ¹_{k̄}` itself.

iter-178+ body: a non-constant morphism between smooth proper curves
over `k̄` is automatically finite (proper + quasi-finite). The
function-field extension `k̄(ℙ¹) ↪ K(C)` is finite of some degree
`d = [K(C) : k̄(ℙ¹)] ≥ 1`. Take `D := φ^*[∞] ∈ Div(C)` via the standard
"pullback of a Weil divisor along a finite morphism" operation; by
Hartshorne II.6.9, `deg(D) = deg(φ) · deg([∞]) = d · 1 = d`. The
positivity `d ≥ 1` follows from non-constancy (else `deg(φ) = 0` would
force `φ` constant). Both the finite-pullback operation and the
multiplicativity-of-degree identity are project-bespoke sub-lemmas
threaded inside the iter-178+ body (cf. the closely related
`Scheme.WeilDivisor.principal_degree_zero` of `RR.1`).

opening, p. 299; II §6.9 p. 137 for multiplicativity). -/

/-! ## §3. Pin 3 — degree-`1` non-constant morphism between smooth proper curves
is an isomorphism (`iso_of_degree_one`)

Hartshorne I §6 Corollary 6.12 (the function-field ⇔ smooth projective
curve equivalence of categories) specialised to a non-constant
degree-`1` morphism: such a morphism induces an isomorphism on function
fields, and lifts to an isomorphism of schemes by the equivalence.

**Signature refinement (iter-181 Lane I).** The degree-`1` hypothesis
is now encoded directly as
`Module.finrank C'.functionField C.functionField = 1` paired with an
`[Algebra C'.functionField C.functionField]` typeclass binder (the
intended instance at each call site is the canonical `φ`-induced
function-field map). This refines the iter-177 file-skeleton
placeholder hypothesis
`Nonempty (C'.functionField ≃+* C.functionField)`, which is strictly
weaker than what the iter-182+ body needs (the birational-extension
argument requires the iso to be *induced by `φ` itself*, not an
abstract ring iso). See `analogies/ratcurveiso-pin3.md` (Decision 2,
DIVERGE_INTENTIONALLY) for the analysis. The body in iter-182+ uses
either Hartshorne I.6.12 (the equivalence of categories) or the
Mathlib `Scheme.Hom.instIsIsoToNormalizationOfIsIntegralHom` route to
lift the function-field iso to a scheme iso. -/

/-- **Degree-`1` non-constant morphism between smooth proper curves is an
isomorphism** (Hartshorne I Corollary 6.12 specialised to degree `1`,
or equivalently Stacks tag `0AVX`).

For smooth proper geometrically irreducible curves `C, C'` over an
algebraically closed field `k̄` and a non-constant morphism
`φ : C ⟶ C'` such that the induced `k̄`-algebra map on function fields
`φ^# : K(C') → K(C)` makes `K(C)` a one-dimensional `K(C')`-module
(equivalently `[K(C) : K(C')] = 1`), the morphism `φ` is an
isomorphism of `Over (Spec k̄)`-objects.

**Signature refinement (iter-181 Lane I).** The degree-`1` hypothesis
is encoded as a typeclass binder
`[Algebra C'.left.functionField C.left.functionField]` together with
the equation `Module.finrank C'.left.functionField C.left.functionField = 1`.
The intended `Algebra` instance at every call site is the canonical
function-field map induced by `φ` (the composite of
`Scheme.Hom.stalkMap` at the generic point with the `IsFractionRing`
extension to the fraction-field; see Mathlib
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.functionField`). The previous signature took
an abstract existence wrapper
`Nonempty (C'.functionField ≃+* C.functionField)` which is strictly
weaker than what the iter-182+ body needs: the birational-extension
argument requires the iso to be **induced by `φ` itself**, not an
arbitrary ring iso. See `analogies/ratcurveiso-pin3.md` (Decision 2,
DIVERGE_INTENTIONALLY) for the analysis prompting this refinement.

iter-182+ body: invoke the scheme-theoretic argument of Hartshorne's
Corollary I.6.12 (Stacks `0AVX`) — equivalently
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.instIsIsoToNormalizationOfIsIntegralHom`
(see `analogies/ratcurveiso-pin3.md` Steps 1–4):

1. Reduce to `φ` finite (proper + quasi-finite ⟹ finite via
   `IsFinite.iff_isProper_and_isAffineHom`; quasi-finiteness follows
   from the degree-`1` hypothesis collapsing each fibre to a single
   point at the generic point and then extending by closedness).
2. Apply `Scheme.Hom.instIsIsoToNormalizationOfIsIntegralHom` to get
   `Scheme.Hom.toNormalization φ : C ⟶ normalization φ` is an iso.
3. Identify `normalization φ = C'` via smoothness of `C'` (smooth
   proper curve over `k̄` ⟹ regular ⟹ normal). The integral
   closure `O_{C'} ↪ φ_* O_C` is then an equality under the
   `finrank = 1` hypothesis (rank-`1` torsion-free coherent inclusion
   on a Dedekind base is an iso).
4. Compose to extract `C ≅ C'` in the slice category.

Alternative route (cleaner conceptually but more sheaf API): the
pushforward `φ_* O_C` is a coherent `O_{C'}`-module of generic
rank `[K(C) : K(C')] = 1`; the inclusion `O_{C'} ↪ φ_* O_C` is an
iso of coherent rank-`1` sheaves (torsion-free coherent of generic
rank `0` is zero on a Dedekind base), so `φ_* O_C = O_{C'}` and `φ`
is the structure morphism of an iso.
