# Abelian-variety rigidity: morphisms from a genus-`0` curve into an abelian variety are constant

This file scaffolds the project's **committed characteristic-free** genus-`0` route
(route (c)): the abelian-variety rigidity stack. It sits **upstream** of
`AlgebraicJacobian.Jacobian` (it imports only `AlgebraicJacobian.Genus`), breaking the
`RigidityKbar → Rigidity → Jacobian` import cycle so that `genusZeroWitness` can consume the
genus-`0` rigidity keystone directly.

The headline `rigidity_genus0_curve_to_grpScheme` is the char-free replacement (no
`[CharZero kbar]`) for `AlgebraicGeometry.rigidity_over_kbar` of `AlgebraicJacobian.RigidityKbar`
(which remains in tree as the fallback route (a) artifact and still carries `[CharZero]`).

The minimal chain has four links:

1. `rigidity_lemma` — the Rigidity Lemma (Mumford, Form I): the cube-free, cohomology-free
   properness/closed-map entry point. **Proven** (iter-157–159) modulo the single residual
   geometric helper `rigidity_eqOn_saturated_open_to_affine` (bridge 2, the slice-constancy /
   affine-constancy equation), which is the lone `sorry` of the Rigidity-Lemma chain.
2. `morphism_P1_to_grpScheme_const` — every morphism `ℙ¹ → A` into an abelian variety is
   constant (blocked downstream on the theorem of the cube).
3. `genusZero_curve_iso_P1` — a smooth proper geom-irred genus-`0` curve over `k̄` is
   isomorphic to `ℙ¹` (blocked on Riemann–Roch).
4. `rigidity_genus0_curve_to_grpScheme` — THE HEADLINE consumed by `genusZeroWitness`.

See `blueprint/src/chapters/AbelianVarietyRigidity.tex` for the informal sketches and sources
(Mumford, *Abelian Varieties*, Ch. II §4, §6; Milne, *Abelian Varieties*, Prop. 3.10;
Hartshorne, *Algebraic Geometry*, Example IV.1.3.5).

## Encoding notes (iter-157 scaffold)

Mathlib `b80f227` packages no `ℙ¹` as a `Scheme`, so — following the established project idiom
(see `AlgebraicJacobian.RigidityKbar`) — the projective line is encoded by its abstract
characterisation: a smooth proper geometrically irreducible `Over (Spec (.of kbar))` of relative
dimension `1` with `genus = 0`. The signatures of declarations 1–3 are **provisional**
(`SCAFFOLD` comments mark them); the prover may refine the encoding when the bodies are filled.
Declaration 4 is pinned verbatim to `rigidity_over_kbar`'s signature minus `[CharZero kbar]`,
because it is the exact signature the consumer (`genusZeroWitness.key`) needs.

second projection `snd : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Y` with the slice section `y ↦ (x₀, y)` is the "collapse the

`snd ≫ lift (toUnit Y ≫ x₀) (𝟙 Y) = lift (toUnit (X ⊗ Y) ≫ x₀) (snd X Y)`.

Pure cartesian-monoidal algebra (no geometry): `comp_lift` distributes the `snd`, the

uniqueness of maps into the terminal object. -/

/-- **Bridge 1 of the Rigidity Lemma (closed-map step), PROVEN.** When `X` is complete (proper)
over `k̄`, the second monoidal projection `snd : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Y` has, on underlying schemes, a
*closed* base map. This is Mumford's "completeness of `X` makes `p₂` a closed map" (Abelian
Varieties, Ch. II §4, p. 43).

Proof: the underlying scheme morphism `(snd X Y).left` is the pullback projection
`Limits.pullback.snd X.hom Y.hom` (`Over.snd_left`), i.e. the base change of `X.hom` along
`Y.hom`. `IsProper X.hom ⟹ UniversallyClosed X.hom` (`IsProper.toUniversallyClosed`), and
`UniversallyClosed` is stable under base change
(`universallyClosed_isStableUnderBaseChange.of_isPullback` on the canonical pullback square), so
`(snd X Y).left` is universally closed and hence its base map is closed
(`Scheme.Hom.isClosedMap`). Char-free; no theorem of the cube, no cohomology. -/

/-- **Dense-closed-points hom-extensionality (the bespoke globalisation connective, PROVEN).**
Two morphisms `g₁ g₂ : W ⟶ Z` out of a *reduced* scheme `W` whose closed points are *dense*
(`[JacobsonSpace W]` — e.g. when `W` is locally of finite type over a field) into a *separated*
scheme `Z` are equal as soon as they agree at every closed point `x ∈ closedPoints W` after the
canonical residue-field probe `W.fromSpecResidueField x : Spec κ(x) ⟶ W`.

This is the one connective the iter-159 `mathlib-analogist` flagged that Mathlib does **not**
package directly: Mathlib supplies only the single-dominant-morphism `ext_of_isDominant`. Here we
assemble all the closed points into one dominant probe — the coproduct
`∐_{x ∈ closedPoints W} Spec κ(x) ⟶ W`, whose topological range is exactly the (dense) set of
closed points — and feed it to `ext_of_isDominant`. It is `Step 2` of bridge 2's route B
(cohomology-free) and is fully proven here, reusable independently of the rigidity context. -/

/-- **Per-closed-slice constancy (Step 1 of bridge 2's route B), the residual deep geometry.**
With the data of `rigidity_eqOn_saturated_open_to_affine`, fix a *closed* point `x` of the
`p₂`-saturated open `U ⊆ X ⊗ Y` on which `f` lands in the affine `U₀`. Then `f` and the collapsed
map `retract ≫ f` (`retract := lift (toUnit (X ⊗ Y) ≫ x₀) (snd X Y)`, i.e. `(x,y) ↦ (x₀,y)`)
agree at `x` after the residue-field probe `U.fromSpecResidueField x`.

Mumford's "for each `y ∈ V`, the complete slice `X × {y}` maps into the affine, hence to a single
point" step, realised cohomology-FREE. The intended proof (analogist route B, `analogies/
rigidity-affineconst.md`): the closed point `x` lies over a closed point `y = p₂(x) ∈ Vset` with
`κ(y) = k̄` (`[IsAlgClosed kbar]`, finite type); saturation `_hUV` puts the whole proper integral
slice `X_y ≅ X` inside `U`, so `f` maps `X_y` into the affine `U₀`. By
`isField_of_universallyClosed` + `finite_appTop_of_universallyClosed` + alg-closedness,
`Γ(X_y) = k̄`, so `f|X_y` factors through a single `k̄`-point of `U₀` (`ext_of_isAffine`) —
necessarily `f(x₀, y)`, which is exactly `(retract ≫ f)(x)`. The relative Stein / `f_*𝒪 = 𝒪`
framing is a confirmed Mathlib gap and is deliberately avoided.

**Status (iter-160): `sorry` (the genuinely-deep residual of the Rigidity-Lemma chain).** It is
the per-point input that `morphism_eq_of_eqAt_closedPoints` globalises over the dense closed
points. Extracted as a named top-level obligation per the route-B decomposition. -/

/-- **Bridge 2 of the Rigidity Lemma (slice-constancy / the agreement equation), the residual
geometric input.** Let `X` be complete (proper) over an algebraically closed `k̄`, `x₀` a
`k̄`-point of `X`, and `f : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Z` into a separated `Z`. Let `U = p₂⁻¹(V)` be a `p₂`-saturated
open of `X ⊗ Y` (the preimage of a set `Vset ⊆ Y`) on which `f` lands inside a single **affine**
open `U₀ ⊆ Z`. Then `f` agrees on `U` with the collapsed map `retract ≫ f`
(`retract := lift (toUnit (X ⊗ Y) ≫ x₀) (snd X Y)`, i.e. `(x, y) ↦ (x₀, y)`):

  `U.ι ≫ f.left = U.ι ≫ (retract ≫ f).left`.

This is the cohomology-free **route B** of the iter-159 `mathlib-analogist` consult
(`analogies/rigidity-affineconst.md`); it is the genuinely-deep residual of the Rigidity-Lemma
chain (analogist estimate ≈ 1–2 further iterations) and is therefore isolated here as a named
top-level obligation with a precise statement and `sorry` body. The relative Stein-factorisation /
proper-pushforward `f_*𝒪 = 𝒪` framing is a confirmed Mathlib gap and is **deliberately avoided**.

The intended proof (no coherent cohomology):
1. *Per closed slice.* For each closed point `y ∈ Vset`, `κ(y) = k̄` (`[IsAlgClosed kbar]`, finite
   type). Saturation puts the whole fibre `X_y` inside `U`, so `f` maps the proper integral slice
   `X_y ≅ X` into the affine `U₀`. By `isField_of_universallyClosed` +
   `finite_appTop_of_universallyClosed` + alg-closedness, `Γ(X_y) = k̄`, so the slice maps to a
   single `k̄`-point of `U₀`
   (`ext_of_isAffine`); that point is `f(x₀, y)`, since `(x₀, y) ∈ X_y`. Hence `f` and `retract ≫ f`
   agree at every closed point of `U`.
2. *Globalise.* Closed points are dense in the locally-of-finite-type `k̄`-scheme `U`
   (`closure_closedPoints`, the Jacobson-space property). Turning "agrees at each closed point"
   into one dominant probe (the coproduct `∐_{x∈closedPoints U} Spec κ(x) ⟶ U`, dense range) and
   feeding it to `ext_of_isDominant_of_isSeparated'` (the reduced-source / separated-target rigidity
   `rigidity_core` already uses) yields the morphism equality on all of `U`. This last
   "dense-closed-points ⟹ hom-ext" connective is the one piece Mathlib does not package directly. -/

/-- **The dense-open agreement (the genuine geometric content).** Mumford's open
`X × V` together with the slice-constancy `f(x, y) = f(x₀, y)` on it, packaged as the single
existential that `rigidity_core`'s gluing step consumes: there is a non-empty open `U` of
`(X ⊗ Y).left` on which `f` and the collapsed map `retract ≫ f` agree as scheme morphisms.

**Status (iter-159): this lemma is now `sorry`-free in its own body.** The construction of the
non-empty open `U = X × V` (closed-map bridge 1, `snd_left_isClosedMap`) and its non-emptiness
(`y₀ ∉ G` via the collapse hypothesis `_hf`, using the pullback-fibre fact `hfib` over the
`k̄`-point `y₀`) are discharged here. The one remaining geometric input — slice-constancy on `U`
(bridge 2) — is delegated to the named helper `rigidity_eqOn_saturated_open_to_affine` (the lone
`sorry` of the Rigidity-Lemma chain; its affine-containment hypothesis is read off the definition
of `G` inside this proof).

This lemma carries the **collapse hypothesis** `_hf : f(X × {y₀}) = {z₀}` (encoded
`lift (𝟙 X) (toUnit X ≫ y₀) ≫ f = toUnit X ≫ z₀`), which is exactly what makes Mumford's open
`V := Y ∖ G` non-empty (`y₀ ∉ G`, since the rigidified slice `f(X × {y₀}) = {z₀} ⊆ U` lands in
the affine `U`, so its image under `snd` avoids `G = snd '' (f ⁻¹ F)`). Without `_hf` the lemma
is **false** (e.g. `f := fst : X ⊗ Y ⟶ X = Z` has no open of agreement). The full instance set
(`GeometricallyIrreducible`, `IsReduced`, `IsSeparated`) and `_hf` only strengthen the
antecedent.

Of the two char-free Mathlib bridges of `rigidity_core`'s docstring, **bridge 1** (the closed-map
argument, `IsProper.toUniversallyClosed` ⟹ the projection is closed) is discharged here — it
produces the non-empty open `U = X × V`. **Bridge 2** (the affine-constancy argument,
`isField_of_universallyClosed` on each proper integral slice mapping to an affine, supplying the
scheme-level equality on `U`) is the residual content, isolated in the named helper
`rigidity_eqOn_saturated_open_to_affine`. -/

/-- **Geometric core of the Rigidity Lemma (PROVEN, modulo `rigidity_eqOn_dense_open`).** With
`X` complete (proper) and `x₀ : 𝟙_ ⟶ X` a `k̄`-point, the morphism `f : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Z` is invariant
under the "collapse-the-`X`-axis-onto-`x₀`" endomorphism
`retract := lift (toUnit (X ⊗ Y) ≫ x₀) (snd X Y)`:

  `f = retract ≫ f`,

i.e. `f(x, y) = f(x₀, y)` for all `(x, y)` — `f` depends only on the `Y`-coordinate. This is
the entirety of the *geometric* content of Mumford's Rigidity Lemma (Form I); the rest of
`rigidity_lemma` is the cartesian-monoidal algebra discharged by `rigidity_snd_lift`.

This core is now **proven** by the project's scheme-level rigidity (replicated inline from
Mathlib's `ext_of_isDominant_of_isSeparated'`, since the wrapper `Scheme.Over.ext_of_eqOnOpen`
lives in the downstream `AlgebraicJacobian.Rigidity`): two maps out of the geometrically
irreducible reduced `X ⊗ Y` into the separated `Z` that agree on a non-empty open agree
everywhere. The single deferred input is the existence of that non-empty open together with the
agreement on it — `rigidity_eqOn_dense_open` — which is the actual geometry below.

This core carries the **collapse hypothesis** `_hf : f(X × {y₀}) = {z₀}` (encoded
`lift (𝟙 X) (toUnit X ≫ y₀) ≫ f = toUnit X ≫ z₀`), passed straight through to
`rigidity_eqOn_dense_open`: it is exactly what makes Mumford's open `V := Y ∖ G` non-empty
(`y₀ ∉ G`). Without it the core statement is **false** (`f := fst` is not collapse-invariant).

## Mumford's proof of `rigidity_eqOn_dense_open` (Abelian Varieties, Ch. II §4, p. 43)

Set `g(y) = f(x₀, y)` (so `retract ≫ f` is exactly `(x, y) ↦ g(y)`). The open `V` is produced as
follows: let `U` be an affine open neighbourhood of a chosen point in `Z`, `F = Z ∖ U`, and
`G = (snd X Y) '' (f ⁻¹ F)`. Then for each `y ∈ V := Y ∖ G`, the slice `f(X × {y}) ⊆ U`, and `f`
agrees with `retract ≫ f` on the non-empty open `X × V`.

This rests on **two char-free Mathlib bridges** (the cube-free heart); bridge 1 is now **built**,
bridge 2 is the lone residual `sorry` (isolated in `rigidity_eqOn_saturated_open_to_affine`):

  1. **Properness ⇒ the projection is a closed map — BUILT** (`snd_left_isClosedMap`, iter-158).
     `IsProper X.hom` is universally closed (`AlgebraicGeometry.IsProper.toUniversallyClosed`), and
     `snd X Y` is the base change of `X.hom` along `Y.hom`, hence universally closed, hence a closed
     map. The glue identifying the monoidal `snd X Y` in `Over (Spec k̄)` with the scheme-theoretic
     pullback projection `Limits.pullback.snd X.hom Y.hom` is the exact rewrite `Over.snd_left`, and
     `IsClosedMap` is transported across the canonical pullback square via
     `universallyClosed_isStableUnderBaseChange`. So `G = snd '' (closed)` is closed, `V` open.

  2. **A proper connected variety mapping to an affine has image a single point.** For `y ∈ V`,
     the proper connected slice `X × {y}` maps under `f` into the affine `U`; a global regular
     function on a proper integral `k̄`-scheme is constant. Mathlib *has* the key fact:
     `AlgebraicGeometry.isField_of_universallyClosed` — for `X` integral and `f : X ⟶ Spec K`
     universally closed (`K` a field), `Γ(X, ⊤)` is a field. Combined with `Γ(affine U) → Γ(X×{y})`
     being a `k̄`-algebra map into a field that is finite over `k̄`
     (`AlgebraicGeometry.finite_appTop_of_universallyClosed` under `LocallyOfFiniteType`) and
     `k̄` algebraically closed, the map `X × {y} → U` factors through a single point. This is the
     "global-sections-constant" argument; assembling it into "image is one point" is the
     remaining work.

These are exactly the "two Mathlib bridges to find/build" flagged in `PROGRESS.md`. Both bridges
are char-free (no theorem of the cube, no cohomology beyond `H⁰`). As of iter-159, bridge 1 is
built (`snd_left_isClosedMap`) and the non-emptiness fibre fact (`hfib`) is closed, so
`rigidity_eqOn_dense_open` is `sorry`-free in its own body; bridge 2 (slice-constancy) is the lone
residual `sorry`, isolated in the named helper `rigidity_eqOn_saturated_open_to_affine`. The
categorical reduction (`rigidity_lemma`, `rigidity_snd_lift`) and the scheme-level gluing
(`rigidity_core`) are closed. -/

/-- **Rigidity Lemma (Mumford, Form I).** Let `X` be a complete (proper) variety and `Y`, `Z`
any varieties over `k̄`. If `f : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Z` collapses the slice `X × {y₀}` to a single point
`z₀` (encoded as `lift (𝟙 X) (toUnit X ≫ y₀) ≫ f = toUnit X ≫ z₀`), then `f` factors through
the second projection `snd : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Y`, i.e. there is `g : Y ⟶ Z` with `f = snd ≫ g`.

This is the cube-free, cohomology-free entry point of the chain: its only inputs are that
completeness of `X` makes the projection a closed map, and that a proper connected variety has
no nonconstant map to an affine variety. Valid in arbitrary characteristic.

SCAFFOLD: signature refined by the iter-157 prover; see blueprint `thm:rigidity_lemma`
(Mumford, *Abelian Varieties*, Ch. II §4, p. 43).

## iter-157 signature correction (the scaffold was false as stated)

The iter-157 scaffold carried only `[IsProper X.hom]`. **That statement is false**: take `X` =
two disjoint reduced `k̄`-points (proper but disconnected), `Y` = two points, `Z = X`, and
`f : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Z` collapsing the `y₀`-fibre to one point while separating the other fibre. Then
`_hf` holds yet `f` does not factor through `snd`. Mumford's hypothesis is that `X` is a complete
**variety** (irreducible) and `Y`, `Z` are **varieties**; the formal statement therefore needs
`X ⊗ Y` geometrically irreducible and reduced (so the dense-open rigidity glue applies) and `Z`
separated (so agreement on a dense open propagates). These three instances are added; they are
exactly what `Scheme.Over.ext_of_eqOnOpen` (the gluing step) consumes, and what Milne's Rigidity
Theorem 1.1 lists ("`V` complete, `V × W` geometrically irreducible, `Z` separated").

## iter-157 prover progress

The categorical *skeleton* is fully discharged here; only the single geometric core
remains. Concretely, Mumford "chooses any point `x₀ ∈ X`" and sets `g(y) = f(x₀, y)`. We
make this explicit by adding a `k̄`-point `x₀ : 𝟙_ ⟶ X` to the hypotheses (Mumford's
"complete variety `X`" is nonempty, so over `k̄` such a point exists; the downstream
consumer `morphism_P1_to_grpScheme_const` supplies it from `ℙ¹`). The witness is then

  `g := lift (toUnit Y ≫ x₀) (𝟙 Y) ≫ f`   (the section `y ↦ (x₀, y)` post-composed with `f`).

The goal `f = snd X Y ≫ g` rewrites — by pure cartesian-monoidal algebra (`comp_lift`,
`toUnit` uniqueness, `Category.comp_id`) — to

  `f = retract ≫ f`,   where   `retract := lift (toUnit (X ⊗ Y) ≫ x₀) (snd X Y)`

is the endomorphism `(x, y) ↦ (x₀, y)` of `X ⊗ Y` that collapses the `X`-axis onto `x₀`.
This reduction (lemma `rigidity_snd_lift`, then one `rw`) is closed below. The
remaining `f = retract ≫ f` is the genuine geometric heart (`rigidity_core`): `f` depends
only on the `Y`-coordinate. Its proof is Mumford's properness/closed-map/affine-constant
argument — see `rigidity_core` for the full decomposition into the two char-free bridges.

**Status (iter-159)**: categorical reduction (`rigidity_snd_lift`) and scheme-level gluing
(`rigidity_core`, `rigidity_eqOn_dense_open`) all closed. The lone residual `sorry` of the whole
chain is bridge 2, the slice-constancy helper `rigidity_eqOn_saturated_open_to_affine`. -/

/-- **A morphism `ℙ¹ → A` is constant.** Over an algebraically closed field `k̄`, every

`a₀ : 𝟙_ ⟶ A`, i.e. `f = toUnit ℙ¹ ≫ a₀`.

The single-curve base case of Milne's Proposition 3.10. Cube-free Rigidity-Lemma additivity
