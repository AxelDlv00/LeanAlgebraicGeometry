# Weil divisors on a smooth proper curve (RR.1)

This file is the **RR.1** sub-build chapter for the project's headline
`genusZero_curve_iso_P1` (the "smooth proper geom-irred genus-`0` curve over `k̄` is
isomorphic to `ℙ¹`" lemma in `AlgebraicJacobian.AbelianVarietyRigidity`).

Mathlib `b80f227` ships no `WeilDivisor` on a scheme; adjacent pieces
(`MeromorphicOn.divisor`, `CommRing.Pic`, `Scheme.RationalMap`) cover different
ground. This file is therefore **project-bespoke**, scaffolding the formal-sum data
type `Div(X) = ⨁_{Y ⊂ X codim 1} ℤ` on a Noetherian integral scheme `X` satisfying
Hartshorne's condition `(*)`, the principal-divisor homomorphism
`div : K(X)^× → Div(X)` on a curve, the degree map `deg : Div(C) → ℤ` on a smooth
proper curve over an algebraically closed field, the degree-zero of principal divisors
on a complete nonsingular curve (Hartshorne Cor. II.6.10), and the linear-equivalence
relation `D ~ D'`.

## Status (iter-172 file-skeleton)

This file is the **iter-172 Lane C** file-skeleton: each declaration carries the
intended signature (matching the blueprint `\lean{...}` pin) with a `sorry` body.
The bodies are iter-173+ work after the sibling chapters `RR.2`
(`RiemannRoch_RRFormula.tex`), `RR.3` (`RiemannRoch_OcOfD.tex`), and `RR.4`
(`RiemannRoch_RationalIsoP1.tex`) land.

The 9 pinned declarations are:

1. `Scheme.WeilDivisor` — free abelian group on prime divisors (Definition).
2. `Scheme.RationalMap.order` — order of a rational function along a prime divisor.
3. `Scheme.WeilDivisor.ofClosedPoint` — Weil divisor associated to a closed point.
4. `Scheme.WeilDivisor.degree` — degree map over an algebraically closed base.
5. `Scheme.WeilDivisor.degree_hom` — degree is a group homomorphism (Theorem).
6. `Scheme.WeilDivisor.principal` — principal divisor of a rational function.
7. `Scheme.WeilDivisor.principal_hom` — `div` is a group homomorphism (Theorem).
8. `Scheme.WeilDivisor.principal_degree_zero` — `deg ∘ div = 0` on a complete curve.
9. `Scheme.WeilDivisor.LinearEquivalence` — linear equivalence of Weil divisors.

/-! ## §1. Codim-1 cycle group / Weil divisor group

Hartshorne's condition `(*)` (II §6, p. 130) is: `X` is a Noetherian integral
separated scheme that is regular in codimension one. Under `(*)`, prime divisors
are closed integral subschemes of codimension one, and the local ring at the
generic point of a prime divisor is a DVR with quotient field the function field
`K(X)`.

A prime divisor is encoded by its **generic point** together with the
codimension-one witness `Order.coheight point = 1`: the data field `point : X`
selects the generic point of the closed integral subscheme, and the predicate
field `coheight` enforces codimension one in the specialisation preorder
(Hartshorne II §6 p. 130; blueprint pin `def:prime_divisor`). Integrality of the
closure is automatic, so no separate integrality witness is needed.
-/

/-- A **prime divisor** on a scheme `X`: a closed integral subscheme of codimension
one, encoded (for a scheme satisfying Hartshorne's condition `(*)`) by its generic
point. On a curve, prime divisors correspond bijectively to closed points.

The codimension-one witness is the predicate `Order.coheight point = 1` on the
specialisation preorder of `X.carrier` (Mathlib's convention is
`x ≤ y ↔ y ⤳ x`, so the generic point is the unique maximal element and a
generic point of a codim-1 closed integral subscheme has a length-one chain
above it). The closure `{point}̄` is automatically irreducible (so the reduced
induced subscheme structure is automatically integral); hence no separate
integrality field is needed.

/-! ## §2. Order of a rational function at a prime divisor

For a scheme `X` satisfying `(*)`, every prime divisor `Y` carries a discrete
valuation `v_Y` on the function field `K(X)`. The order of a nonzero rational
function `f ∈ K(X)^×` along `Y` is the integer `ord_Y(f) := v_Y(f)`. -/

/-- **Order of a nonzero rational function `f ∈ K(X)^×` along a prime divisor `Y`.**

For `X` satisfying Hartshorne's `(*)`, the local ring `O_{X,η}` at the generic
point `η` of `Y` is a discrete valuation ring with quotient field the function
field `K(X)`, and `ord_Y(f) = v_Y(f) ∈ ℤ` is the value of the associated normalised
discrete valuation on `f`.

On a smooth proper curve `C` over `k̄`, every closed point `P ∈ C` is a prime
divisor and `ord_P(f) = v_P(f)` is the standard DVR valuation at `P`.

Blueprint reference: `def:order_at_point` (Hartshorne II §6 pp. 130–131; Stacks 02ME).

`X.presheaf.stalk Y.point`, then projects through `WithZero.log : ℤᵐ⁰ → ℤ`
(the canonical projection with junk-on-zero, `Mathlib.Algebra.GroupWithZero.WithZero`).
On `f = 0` this gives `order Y 0 = 0` (junk convention from `WithZero.log_zero`).

Hartshorne's condition `(*)` includes "regular in codimension one", i.e.\ every
prime divisor `Y` of `X` has a DVR stalk `O_{X,Y.point}`. Mathlib has no direct
typeclass for this; we package it as the project-bespoke class
`Scheme.IsRegularInCodimensionOne`, with an instance synthesising the per-`Y`
Krull-dim-≤-1 condition required by `Scheme.RationalMap.order`. Blueprint pin

ship. The body is a Mathlib-upstream-pending gap (Stacks tag `02RV` — for a

many height-one primes can divide either numerator or denominator); the proof
factors through `IsLocallyNoetherian X` + the principal-ideal generation of
height-1 primes + the finite irreducible-component decomposition of
`V(f₀) ∪ V(f∞)`. The chapter pins this as a separate sub-build deferral
(`RiemannRoch_WeilDivisor.tex` §5).

/-! ## §3. Divisor of a closed point on a curve

On a smooth proper curve `C` over a field, every closed point `P ∈ C` is a prime
divisor (it is closed, integral, of codimension one in the one-dimensional integral
scheme `C`). The associated Weil divisor is `[P] = 1 · P ∈ Div(C)`. -/

/-- **The Weil divisor associated to a closed point `P` on a curve.** The element
`[P] := 1 · P ∈ Div(C)`, i.e. the prime divisor `P` with multiplicity one.

For a smooth proper curve every closed point is automatically a prime divisor (it
is a codimension-one integral closed subscheme of the one-dimensional integral
scheme `C`); conversely every prime divisor on a curve is of this form, so an
arbitrary divisor on `C` is a finite formal `ℤ`-linear combination
`Σ nᵢ · [Pᵢ]` of closed points.

Blueprint reference: `def:divisor_closed_point` (Hartshorne II §6 p. 137).

iter-174 body: the function is junk-defined outside its intended scope. We
case-split on `Order.coheight P = 1` (the codimension-one witness of
`PrimeDivisor`). On the branch where the equality holds — automatic for a
closed point on a one-dimensional integral scheme — we promote `P` to a
`PrimeDivisor` via the witness and return `Finsupp.single ⟨P, h⟩ 1`, i.e.
the prime divisor `P` with multiplicity one. On the off-branch (junk regime)
we return the zero divisor. The blueprint pins the well-definedness argument
"`IsClosed {P}` on a one-dimensional integral scheme ⟹ `coheight P = 1`" as a
separate threadable hypothesis at the call site (chapter L330–L340 "Lean

/-- In the hypothesised regime where the closed point `P` has coheight one

/-- **Degree of a Weil divisor on a smooth proper curve over `k̄`.**

Over an algebraically closed field `k̄`, every closed point of a smooth proper
curve `C` has residue field `k̄`, so each prime divisor `[P]` contributes degree
one to the sum, and `deg(D) := Σᵢ nᵢ` is the sum of the integer coefficients of
the formal sum `D = Σ nᵢ · [Pᵢ]`.

(Over a general field `k` one weights by the residue-field degrees
`Σᵢ nᵢ · [κ(Pᵢ) : k]` to recover the geometric degree; the project's RR bridge
needs only the `k̄` specialisation.)

/-- **The principal divisor of a nonzero rational function `f ∈ K(X)^×`.**

By Hartshorne's Lemma 6.1, `ord_Y(f) = 0` for all but finitely many prime
divisors `Y`, so the formal sum
`div(f) := Σ_{Y prime divisor} ord_Y(f) · Y ∈ Div(X)`
has finite support and is a well-defined Weil divisor.

On a smooth proper curve `C` over `k̄`, this specialises to
`div(f) = Σ_{P closed point} ord_P(f) · [P]`.

For every nonzero rational function `f ∈ K(C)^×` on a smooth proper curve `C`

`deg(div(f)) = 0 ∈ ℤ`.

Blueprint reference: `thm:principal_deg_zero` (Hartshorne II.6 Cor. 6.10 p. 138).

The proof (Hartshorne 6.10): if `f ∈ k̄` is constant then `div(f) = 0` and the
claim is trivial. Otherwise the inclusion `k̄(f) ⊂ K(C)` exhibits `K(C)` as a
finite extension of `k̄(f) ≅ k̄(t)`, so the corresponding morphism
`φ : C → ℙ¹_{k̄}` is finite, `div(f) = φ^*([0] - [∞])`, and pullback along a
finite morphism multiplies degree by `deg(φ)`. Two auxiliary sub-lemmas
(finite morphism induced by a non-constant rational function; multiplicativity
of degree under finite pullback, Hartshorne II.6.9) are deferred to follow-up

/-! ## §6. Positive part of a Weil divisor

Iter-190 plan-phase Lane I Pin 2 corrective substrate. The carrier
`X.WeilDivisor = X.PrimeDivisor →₀ ℤ` is a finitely supported integer-valued
function on prime divisors; the *positive part* `(D)_0` is obtained by
replacing each coefficient `n_Y` with `max(n_Y, 0)`. Equivalently this is
the lattice join `D ⊔ 0` in the pointwise lattice structure (the
`semilatticeSup` instance on `Finsupp` is noncomputable). The complementary
*negative part* `(D)_∞ := (-D)_0` then gives the canonical decomposition
`D = (D)_0 - (D)_∞` into a difference of effective divisors.

/-- **Positive part of a Weil divisor**.

`positivePart D` is the divisor obtained from `D` by replacing each
coefficient `n_Y` with `max(n_Y, 0)` (equivalently `D ⊔ 0` in the
pointwise lattice structure on `Finsupp`). For `D = div(f)` on a smooth
proper curve `C`, this recovers the divisor-of-zeros `(f)_0` — the
formal sum of the zeros of `f` with their multiplicities.

The complementary `negativePart D := positivePart (-D)` then gives
`D = positivePart D - negativePart D` as a difference of effective
divisors.

Implementation: `Finsupp.mapRange (fun n : ℤ => n ⊔ 0) (by simp)`, the
generic Mathlib packaging that maps a finsupp's coefficients through a
zero-preserving function. (The `D ⊔ 0` lattice form is equivalent but
requires the noncomputable `Finsupp.semilatticeSup` synthesis on
`PrimeDivisor →₀ ℤ`; the explicit `mapRange` form is more transparent
to typeclass synthesis.)

the support of `D`.

This is the iter-192 structural-reduction helper consumed by

For a smooth proper geometrically irreducible curve `C` over an algebraically
closed field `kbar`, and a finite extension `K → K(C)` of function fields
(arising as the pullback along a non-constant morphism `C → ℙ¹` of the
function field `K(ℙ¹)`), given any non-zero element `t ∈ K` that serves as
a local parameter at `∞ ∈ ℙ¹` (the project's canonical witness being
`(localParameterAtInfty kbar).val`), the degree of the positive part of
the principal divisor of `algebraMap K K(C) t` equals the function-field
extension degree:
\[
  \deg\bigl((\mathrm{div}\,(\varphi^{\#}\,t))_0\bigr)
  \;=\; [K(C) : K] \;=\; \mathrm{Module.finrank}_{K} K(C).
\]
Equivalently, `(div (φ^# t))_0 = φ^*[∞]` and `deg(φ^*[∞]) = deg(φ)`
(Hartshorne II.6.9 specialised at `D = [∞]`).

iter-191 reshape: this theorem is now in **equation form** with `t` and
`halg` taken as explicit parameters, matching the shape required by the
consumer `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.poleDivisor_degree_eq_finrank` in
`RationalCurveIso.lean` (which evaluates at the specific witness
`(localParameterAtInfty kbar).val` rather than at an existentially chosen
one). The previous existential form (`∃ t halg, …`) is now obtained as
the projection of this equation form onto the existence-of-witness
fragment.

Iter-193 fix: added the explicit `hlp` hypothesis encoding the
local-parameter constraint via "order equals `1` at some prime divisor".
Without it the equation is mathematically false (take `K = K(C)` with
`t = 1`: LHS `= 0`, RHS `= 1`). The hypothesis pins `t` to be a
uniformiser at some closed point of `C`, which is precisely what the
chapter prose's affine-chart `Ideal.sum_ramification_inertia` chain
requires to identify `(div(φ^# t))_0 = φ^*[∞]`.

The body (~50-80 LOC owed iter-191+) chains
`Ideal.sum_ramification_inertia` + `Ideal.finrank_quotient_map` on the
Dedekind extension `A → B` at the maximal ideal `m_∞ = (t) ⊂ A`, per
`analogies/ratcurveiso-pin2.md` Decision 2.

/-! ## §7. Linear equivalence and the divisor class group -/

/-- **Linear equivalence of Weil divisors.**

Two Weil divisors `D, D' ∈ Div(X)` are linearly equivalent, written `D ~ D'`, if
and only if there exists a nonzero rational function `f ∈ K(X)^×` with
`D - D' = div(f) ∈ Div(X)`.

`~` is an equivalence relation (reflexivity from `div(1) = 0`, symmetry from
`div(f⁻¹) = -div(f)`, transitivity from `div(fg) = div(f) + div(g)`, all via
`thm:principal_hom`). The quotient `Cl(X) := Div(X) / im(div)` is the
**divisor class group** of `X`.

On a smooth proper curve `C` over `k̄`, `thm:principal_deg_zero` shows the
degree map descends to `deg : Cl(C) → ℤ`.
