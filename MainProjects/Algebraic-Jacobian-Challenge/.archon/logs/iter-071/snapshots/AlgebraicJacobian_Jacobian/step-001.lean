/-! # The Jacobian of a smooth proper curve

The Jacobian of a smooth, proper, geometrically irreducible curve over a field, equipped with
its structure as an abelian variety.

## Status (iteration 069 — Phase C scaffolding)

The genus-0 case is closed: `Jacobian C = 𝟙_ (Over (Spec (.of k)))` (the terminal object),
which is `Spec k` with its identity morphism. For `g > 0`, the definition reduces to the
Albanese construction (deferred).

The file now contains:
- `IsAlbanese`: the Albanese universal property for a pointed curve.
- `IsAlbanese.unique`: uniqueness of the Albanese object up to canonical isomorphism.
- Decomposition of the five protected sorries into genus-0 / genus-pos cases.

### Forbidden shortcut (sanity check)

Defining `Jacobian C := 𝟙_ (Over (Spec (.of k)))` *unconditionally* (the terminal object,
i.e. `Spec k`) compiles and discharges three of the four instances for free, but the
fourth instance `SmoothOfRelativeDimension (genus C) (𝟙_ _).hom` would force `genus C = 0`,
which is mathematically wrong for any curve of genus `≥ 1`. The terminal-object definition
is therefore forbidden when `genus C > 0`.

The iteration-069 resolution is a *conditional* use of the terminal object: it is used
exactly when `genus C = 0`, which is the mathematically correct answer for that case.

/-- Existence of an Albanese witness for every smooth proper geometrically irreducible

scaffolding: it packages all five protected sorries (`Jacobian`, `instGrpObj`,
`smoothOfRelativeDimension_genus`, `instIsProper`, `instGeometricallyIrreducible`)
into a single existence hypothesis.

Mathematically this corresponds to the construction of the Albanese variety of `C`,
classically via symmetric powers $\mathrm{Sym}^g(C)$ and the Abel--Jacobi map
(Brill--Noether--Riemann--Roch), or equivalently as the identity component of the
Picard scheme. Both routes require infrastructure not yet available in Mathlib
(quotients of schemes by finite group actions; FGA representability), so the
existence is assumed and the proof is deferred to a future iteration. -/
