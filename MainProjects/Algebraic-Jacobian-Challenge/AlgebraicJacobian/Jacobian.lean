/-! # The Jacobian of a smooth proper curve

The Jacobian of a smooth, proper, geometrically irreducible curve over a field, equipped with
its structure as an abelian variety.

## Status

The Jacobian is defined uniformly as the underlying scheme of an Albanese witness
(`JacobianWitness`) for the curve `C`; the four protected instances on `Jacobian C` all
project from the witness directly.

The construction is **uniform in the genus**: the witness is the Picard identity
component `Pic⁰_{C/k}` (`picardJacobianWitness`), an abelian variety of dimension
`genus C` built by the FGA route (`AlgebraicJacobian.Picard.*` +
`AlgebraicJacobian.Albanese.*`). There is **no** genus `= 0` / genus `> 0` split: when
`genus C = 0` the tangent space `H¹(C, 𝒪_C)` is `0`-dimensional, so `Pic⁰_{C/k} = Spec k`
falls out automatically. The former separate `genusZeroWitness` lane (with its
`RigidityKbar` / cotangent-vanishing / Frobenius / `ℙ¹`-identification machinery) was a
pre-FGA local optimisation and has been removed.

This file contains exactly ONE `sorry`-bodied mathematical declaration,
`picardJacobianWitness`, whose closure is the FGA construction of `Pic⁰_{C/k}` as an
abelian variety with its Albanese universal property.

The file contains:
- `IsAlbanese`: the Albanese universal property for a pointed curve.
- `IsAlbanese.unique`: uniqueness of the Albanese object up to canonical isomorphism.
- `JacobianWitness`: a bundled candidate Albanese object together with the universal
  property uniformly over the choice of $k$-rational marked point.
- `picardJacobianWitness`: the Albanese witness `J = Pic⁰_{C/k}`, body `sorry`.
- `nonempty_jacobianWitness`: existence of an Albanese witness for every curve,
  delegating to `picardJacobianWitness`.
- `Jacobian` and its four protected instances, each obtained by projection from the
  Albanese witness.

### Forbidden shortcut (sanity check)

Defining `Jacobian C := 𝟙_ (Over (Spec (.of k)))` *unconditionally* (the terminal object,
i.e. `Spec k`) compiles and discharges three of the four instances for free, but the
fourth instance `SmoothOfRelativeDimension (genus C) (𝟙_ _).hom` would force `genus C = 0`,
which is mathematically wrong for any curve of genus `≥ 1`. The terminal-object definition
is therefore forbidden when `genus C > 0`. The witness-based definition avoids this
issue: the witness's `J` is `Pic⁰_{C/k}`, which is `Spec k` exactly when `genus C = 0`
and the honest Albanese object otherwise.

/-- A bundled Albanese witness for the smooth proper geometrically irreducible curve
`C`: a candidate group scheme `J` (with proper, smooth, geometrically irreducible
structure, smooth of relative dimension `genus C`), and a proof that `J` satisfies
the Albanese universal property of Definition `IsAlbanese` for `C` *for every choice
of $k$-rational marked point* `P : 𝟙_ _ ⟶ C`.

Mathematically, the underlying scheme `J` (and its group/proper/smooth/irreducible
structure) is intrinsic to `C`; only the universal morphism `C ⟶ J` depends on the
choice of marked point `P`. Encoding `isAlbaneseFor` as a `∀ P, IsAlbanese …` field
keeps the bundle independent of any specific pointing, which is what
`AbelJacobi.Jacobian.ofCurve P` needs in order to project the Albanese morphism for
an *arbitrary* input `P`.

The smoothness witness is recorded at the specific relative dimension `genus C`,
which is the form required by `Jacobian.smoothOfRelativeDimension_genus`. -/

/-- The Albanese witness for a smooth proper geometrically irreducible curve `C`,
constructed **uniformly in the genus** as the identity component `Pic⁰_{C/k}` of the
Picard scheme of `C`.

By the FGA route (`AlgebraicJacobian.Picard.*`), `Pic⁰_{C/k}` is representable
(`Scheme.PicScheme.representable`) and is an abelian variety of dimension `genus C`:
its tangent space at the identity is `H¹(C, 𝒪_C)` (`Scheme.Pic0.tangentSpaceIso`),
giving smoothness of relative dimension `genus C` (`Scheme.Pic0.smooth`), properness
(`Scheme.Pic0.proper`), and geometric irreducibility
(`Scheme.Pic0.geometricallyIrreducible`); the Albanese universal property is the
Abel–Jacobi factorisation of `AlgebraicJacobian.Albanese.AlbaneseUP`.

The genus-`0` case is **not** special and needs no separate construction: when
`genus C = 0` the tangent space is `0`-dimensional, so `Pic⁰_{C/k} = Spec k`
automatically, and the universal property degenerates to the (then trivial) statement
that every pointed morphism `C ⟶ A` into an abelian variety is constant. The former
`genusZeroWitness` / `positiveGenusWitness` genus split — together with its bespoke
rigidity / cotangent-vanishing / Frobenius / `ℙ¹`-identification machinery — has been
removed in favour of this single uniform witness. -/
