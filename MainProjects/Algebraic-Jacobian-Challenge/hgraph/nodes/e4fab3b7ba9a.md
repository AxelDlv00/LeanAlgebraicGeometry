instance anyone would use, `¬H`. The theorem is true, axiom-clean, non-vacuous by every probe
in this file, and empty.

Measured instance (2026-07-28, `RiemannRoch/Adelic/LedgerClosure.lean`): `chi_eq_of_bump`
takes `hbump : ∀ P E, χ(1·P + E) = χ(E) + residueDeg P`. Its only producer,
`ChiLedger.chi_add_eq_residueDeg`, carries the side condition that `P` lie in the overlap
`U₀ ∩ U₁` of the chosen affine cover. Off the overlap the same file's
`sectionSub_add_pointDivisor_of_notMem_overlap` gives `A(1·P + E) = A(E)`, so the local step
is a subsingleton, its `finrank` is `0`, and `ChiLedger.chi_add` yields a χ-jump of `0`
against `hbump`'s `residueDeg P ≥ 1`. The exceptional set is empty only for `U₀ = U₁ = ⊤`,
impossible for a 2-affine cover of a proper curve.

What defeats each check, in order: `#print axioms` sees a clean line; a consistency witness
exists (`bump_of_isEmpty_primeDivisor`, on a scheme with no prime divisors); an elaboration
probe synthesises every binder; and non-vacuity in the trap-(c) sense holds, because the
hypothesis is not contradictory — it is merely refutable where it is wanted. The only check
that finds it is reading the PRODUCER's side conditions and asking whether the family the
hypothesis quantifies over contains members where the tree proves the negation.

So the discipline this adds to the other six: for a hypothesis quantified over a family, do
not stop at "is it satisfiable". Ask where the project can derive its negation. Recorded as
I-0449 with the machine-checked step, and as the durable lesson I-0451.

§6b Cluster-P extensions (task ajc-rr).  Independent re-verification, in the
rooted environment, of the axiom claims made in I-0383 and I-0403.

CAUTION, and this is the section to read before quoting any line below as a
completeness claim: several of these are axiom-clean and still NOT unconditional
mathematics, because they take the closed χ-ledger and/or a peel-surjectivity
datum as *named hypotheses* — invisible to `#print axioms`.  What each one is
open in, as of 2026-07-27:

| declaration                          | open named hypotheses                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `chi_eq_of_linearEquivalence`        | none (unconditional)                     |
| `degK`                               | none (a definition)                      |

| `ell_eq_zero_of_degK_neg`            | closed χ-ledger                          |
| `chi_divisorOfList_eq_degK`          | closed χ-ledger                          |
| `coneVanishing_iff_base_and_peel`    | none (unconditional; an equivalence)     |
| `exists_bound_subsingleton_h1Mod`    | base vanishing at one divisor + peel     |
| `exists_bound_subsingleton_h1Mod_of_pointPeel` | base vanishing + point-peel    |
| `exists_bound_h1dim_eq_zero`         | the above, plus the closed χ-ledger      |

The honest one-line summary of the vanishing lane, in ajc-rr's own sharpened
words: single-field bounded `H¹` vanishing is assembled and kernel-checked, and
its hypothesis pair (base vanishing at one divisor plus peel-surjectivity) is
*equivalent* to vanishing on the whole cone `{D' ≥ D₀}` — that equivalence is
proved (`coneVanishing_iff_base_and_peel`).  So the content is "pointwise cone
vanishing plus closed ledger ⟹ numerical-degree vanishing", a real reduction,
since a divisor of large weighted degree need not dominate `D₀`.  It is NOT "one
vanishing implies all vanishing".  Extension-uniformity and global generation are
proved nowhere in AJC, and extension-uniformity is not currently even statable:
the invariants are pinned to a chosen 2-affine cover and `CurveBaseChange.lean`
does not transport it.

One further caveat that no axiom line shows.  "`Subsingleton` rather than
`h¹ = 0`, so no finiteness instance is needed" holds only for the
vanishing-criterion and peel machinery.  Any theorem taking the closed χ-ledger
carries finiteness content with no `Module.Finite` binder visible, because
`Module.finrank` of an infinite-dimensional space is `0`. -/

/-! §6d The global-generation and ledger-closure lane (task ajc-rr, requested in I-0410).

Same caution as §6b, and ajc-rr asked for it to be kept: everything in the generation
lane takes the closed χ-ledger `hledger` as an explicit hypothesis, so a clean axiom line
on `exists_bound_generatedAt` says nothing about the ledger being available.  Measured
open named hypotheses, read off the signatures rather than asserted:

§6e The fourth trap, and why the apparent exception in the table above is not one.

`hasRationalResidues_of_isAlgClosed` looks like the one unconditional statement of the
lane: no ledger, no vanishing, no bump, and it measures clean.  It is not, and the reason
is a way of overstating a result that the other three traps do not cover.

Its obligations are in *instance* position, not in named-hypothesis position:
`[Algebra k (X.presheaf.stalk P.point)]`,
`[IsScalarTower k (X.presheaf.stalk P.point) X.functionField]` and
`[Module.Finite k (IsLocalRing.ResidueField (X.presheaf.stalk P.point))]`.  Nothing in
this project constructs any of the last two for the ambient object the Adelic lane runs
on — a bare `Scheme X` — and the first exists only for `Over (Spec k)` objects.  The
`Module.Finite` binder is on the stalk residue field, which the lane has no identification
with its own `localStepTgt` keystone, so it is a new obligation rather than a reused one.

So the fourth trap, in the same form as the other three:

  (d) a theorem whose INSTANCE BINDERS are never instantiable for the object actually
      used reports `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` and always will, because the
      binders are hypotheses.  The axiom output cannot see this at all; the check is
      whether each binder has a constructing instance for the ambient object.

The statement is still a real reduction — `[κ(P) : k] = 1` is traded for standard stalk
commutative algebra — but it is a relocation of the obligation, not a discharge, and the
two `_of_hasRationalResidues` results are therefore not unconditional over an
algebraically closed field either.

RESOLVED, and the resolution is what makes trap (d) worth stating rather than merely
embarrassing.  `RiemannRoch/Adelic/ResidueField.lean` supplies the `_curve` forms below,
which take no stalk binders at all: only the curve's own geometric instances, with the
stalk algebra and tower *built* (`algebraMap_stalk_functionField`,
`isScalarTower_stalk_functionField`) and the residue-field finiteness routed around
entirely through mathlib's `residueFieldIsoBase`, which gets integrality of `κ(x)` over `k`
from `LocallyOfFiniteType` by the Jacobson-space criterion.  So the same mathematics that
was a relocation in the `_of_hasRationalResidues` form is a discharge in the `_curve` form,
and the difference is invisible to `#print axioms`: both report clean.  That is trap (d)
stated positively — the axiom line was never the thing that distinguished them.

`degK_eq_degree_of_isAlgClosed_curve` is the one to look at: geometric degree equals the
residue-weighted degree on an AJC curve over an algebraically closed field, with no open
input at all.  `degree_principal_eq_zero_of_isAlgClosed_curve` then rests on the closed
ledger alone, where its `_of_hasRationalResidues` predecessor needed the ledger *and* the
approximation statement.

ONE QUALIFICATION, established by elaborating a consumer rather than by reading signatures,
because that is the discipline trap (d) demands.  These take an `Adelic.IsConstantField k
C.left` binder whose producer (`Scheme.instIsConstantField`, `Adelic/GateInstances.lean`) is
a `scoped` instance.  A consumer must therefore `open scoped AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme`; a
`degK_eq_degree_of_isAlgClosed_curve` applied without it fails to synthesize, and the
failure looks exactly like trap (d) even though the instance exists.  Instantiability is
`open`-sensitive, which is a fifth thing no axiom line shows and the reason to test the
consumer instead of the signature. -/

-- §6c The rigid-pushforward gate (task ajc-gate).  THE GATE IS NOW INSTANTIATED AND THE
-- INSTANCE IS AXIOM-CLEAN — `instHasRigidPushforwardOfCurve`
-- (`Picard/RigidPushforwardGammaBaseChange.lean`), for every AJC curve, with no hypothesis
-- beyond the curve's own.  This is the one case in this file where a global instance is
-- *good* news, and it is exactly the case where the measurement matters most: the whole
-- point of §8 below is that a `sorry`-bodied instance poisons every synthesis site, so an
-- instance that measures clean has to be checked, not assumed.  The three extraction
-- theorems of `Picard/RigidPushforward.lean` now synthesize their gate rather than
-- assuming it, and §6c-headlines below measures them at that synthesis site.
--
-- `hasRigidPushforward_of_leaves` is a four-leaf FACTORIZATION, of historical interest
-- only now that the gate is a theorem; it was never the frontier once two of its leaves
-- were proved.
--
-- THIRD TRAP, worse than the first two, demonstrated in this very cone (I-0395): a
-- theorem whose named hypothesis is FALSE is vacuously true, and reports clean axioms
-- like any other.  `hrank`, one of the gate's extracted leaves, quantifies over every
-- finitely presented module with no flatness or fibrewise-vanishing hypothesis, and is
-- refuted by `𝒪_{ℙ¹_A}/x` (rank 0 against fibre `h⁰ = 1`).  So the assembly theorems
-- above it are clean, true, and empty.  `#print axioms` sees none of this.  It answers
-- exactly one question — "is a `sorry` reachable from this proof term" — and four
-- separate things it cannot see have now been measured here:
--   (a) a sorry-bodied INSTANCE reached only at a synthesis site (§8);
--   (b) a named hypothesis in the STATEMENT that is unproved (§6b);
--   (c) a named hypothesis in the statement that is FALSE (§6c);
--   (d) an INSTANCE BINDER that nothing can instantiate for the ambient object (§6e).
-- A fifth, outside this file: an unrooted module cannot be probed at all, because
-- `import AlgebraicJacobian` does not reach it (companion measurement 2 in the header).
#print axioms AlgebraicGeometry.Adelic.hasRigidPushforward_of_leaves

-- The gate's state after `Picard/RigidPushforwardInstance.lean`.  Two of the three
-- statements the frontier file listed are now theorems and this is where that is
-- measured rather than taken on report: `instIsIntegralP1OverLeft` (from the chart-ring
-- identification `Γ(ℙ¹_k, D₊(Xᵢ)) ≃ₐ[k] k[T]` plus the two-chart irreducibility
-- argument) and `p1RankIdentity_proved` carry no named hypotheses at all, so a clean
-- line on them is an unconditional discharge in the §6d sense.  The two consequences
-- are clean and conditional in the *other* direction: they quantify over the curve's
-- own instances only, which for an AJC curve are synthesized.
--
-- `hasRigidPushforward_of_gammaBaseChange` was the honest residue when the gate's cost was
-- one statement; `rigidPushforwardGammaBaseChange_proved` now supplies that statement, so
-- the reduction closed rather than merely narrowing.  Both are measured, along with the
-- resulting instance and the three extraction theorems AT THEIR SYNTHESIS SITE — which is
-- the only measurement that distinguishes a real discharge from trap (a).

/-! §8 The synthesis leak, measured rather than assumed.

A `#print axioms` on a declaration that *quantifies over* `[HasPicScheme C]`
reports the axioms of the declaration only, because the hypothesis is discharged
by the caller.  The leak the audit is about happens one step later: at a call
site where Lean must **synthesise** the instance, and the only producer is the
`sorry`-bodied `instHasPicScheme`.  The two `example`s below force exactly that
synthesis, so their axiom sets measure what a consumer of the theorem actually
gets.  `Flat` likewise has honest producers, so the flat-pullback probe is
stated at an identity morphism, whose flatness is proved. -/
